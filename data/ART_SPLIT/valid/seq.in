Determination of the in vivo pharmacokinetics of palladium-bacteriopheophorbide (WST09) in EMT6 tumour-bearing Balb/c mice using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy
Palladium-bacteriopheophorbide (WST09), a novel bacteriochlorophyll derivative, is currently being investigated for use as a photodynamic therapy (PDT) drug due to its strong absorption in the near-infrared region and its ability to efficiently generate singlet oxygen when irradiated.
In this study, we determined the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of WST09 in female EMT6 tumour-bearing Balb/c mice in order to determine if selective accumulation of this drug occurs in tumour tissue.
A total of 41 mice were administered WST09 by bolus injection into the tail vein at a dose level of 5.0 ± 0.8 mg kg−1.
Three to six mice were sacrificed at each of 0.08, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, 6.0, 9.0, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h post injection, and an additional three control mice were sacrificed without having been administered WST09.
Terminal blood samples as well as liver, skin, muscle, kidney and tumour samples were obtained from each mouse and analyzed for palladium content (from WST09) using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy (GFAAS).
The representative concentration of WST09 in the plasma and tissues was then calculated.
Biphasic kinetics were observed in the plasma, kidney, and liver with clearance from each of these tissues being relatively rapid.
Skin, muscle and tumour did not show any significant accumulation at all time points investigated.
No selective drug accumulation was seen in the tumour and normal tissues, relative to plasma.
Thus the results of this study indicate that vascular targeting resulting from WST09 in the circulation, as opposed to selective WST09 accumulation in tumour tissues, may be responsible for PDT effects in tumours that have been observed in other WST09 studies.
Bacteriochlorophyll-based derivatives are currently being studied as photochemotherapeutic agents, mainly due to their high molar extinction coefficients in the 760 to 780 nm region of the electromagnetic spectrum.1–3
The bacteriochlorophyll-based compounds have further benefits of low toxicity and fast clearance from tissues.
This results in little to no risk of dark toxicity or lengthy periods of post treatment photosensitivity, a factor which can be a drawback with Photofrin® based photodynamic therapy (PDT).
Palladium bacteriopheophorbide (Fig. 1), code named WST09, is a novel bacteriochlorophyll derivative that is currently in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of recurrent prostate cancer.
To date, investigations concerning the efficacy of WST09-based PDT in in vivo tumour therapy have involved irradiation during or immediately following intravenous injection of the WST09 chromophore,4,5 an approach that targets WST09 in the circulation rather than that which might accumulate in tumour tissues at times well after administration such as occurs with other approved PDT drugs.6–8
Results on WST09 have shown high cure rates of mice with prostate small cell carcinoma xenografts,9 and PDT treatment data collected so far provide preliminary indications that vasculature targeted PDT is effective with this drug.10–12
However the pharmacokinetics of WST09 accumulation and clearance have yet to be reported in an animal tumour model.
There is mounting evidence that direct cell kill only accounts for about 1 to 2 logs of direct tumour-cell killing,13 and that the required 7 to 8 logs of cell kill required for a tumour cure can mostly be related to a microvasculature target as the initial site of injury.
As a result, knowledge of the time dependent tissue and plasma distribution of WST09 in a tumour-bearing model can elucidate further the mechanism of PDT action of this compound.
In addition, knowledge of the pharmacokinetic behaviour of this compound provides valuable information pertaining to its potential to elicit skin photosensitivity or systemic toxicity.
In the current study we have determined the in vivo pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of WST09 in an EMT6 tumour-bearing Balb/c mouse model after a single intravenous injection.
The analysis was carried out using a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy (GFAAS) method in order to selectively detect the Pd in WST09.
This is a complementary method to those reported previously for monitoring biological samples containing Pd-organometallics14–16.
Palladium-bacteriopheophorbide (WST09) was obtained both in powder form and as a 5 mg mL−1 injection formulation in an alcohol/Cremophor EL®/NaOH based proprietary vehicle from Steba Biotech (Toussus-le-Noble, France).
Stock solution was diluted in the solvent in order to obtain a WST09 concentration of 0.5 mg mL−1 suitable for injection into the mice.
The stock and diluted solutions were protected from light at all times; the dilutions were performed in dim light conditions and all solution containers were wrapped in aluminum foil.
The diluted concentrations were verified by measuring the absorbance of WST09 at 758 nm.
All solvents were commercially available spectroscopic or HPLC grade.
Solvable® digestion solution was obtained from Canberra-Packard.
Cremophor EL® was obtained from Sigma.
A total of 44 female Balb/c mice were obtained from Charles River, Canada.
At the time of injection the mice were between 6 and 16 weeks old and had an average body mass of 19.8 ± 1.6 g.
Each mouse carried an EMT6 mammary adenocarcinoma tumour (NCI Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center CDT Tumour Repository).
This animal/tumour model has been shown in our laboratory to selectively accumulate other Pd-containing drugs suitable for photoactivation.14
The tumours were maintained by serial transplantation of homogenized tumour tissue subdermally into the right flank 3 to 15 days prior to WST09 administration.
Under these conditions, the tumours studied were of roughly equal size, with an average weight at the time of sacrifice of 100 to 150 mg.
Animals were maintained on an ad libitum diet of Agribrands Purina Rodent Chow 5001 and tap water.
Animal care was performed in accordance with the guidelines set forth by both the Queens University Animal Care Committee and the Canadian Council for Animal Care.
All procedures as well as the experimental protocol were peer-reviewed and approved by the Queens University Animal Care Committee prior to the commencement of this study.
The UV-Visible spectra of WST09 dissolved in Solvable®, or prepared in injection formulation as described below, were recorded on a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-160, Kyoto, Japan).
The photosensitizer drug was introduced in the mice via bolus injections of the WST09 formulation into the tail vein at a dose level of 5.0 ±1.0 mg kg−1.
The mice were kept in the dark, with food and water ad libitum, until the time of sacrifice.
Prior to sacrifice the back of each mouse was depilated using Nair® Lotion Hair Remover (Carter Horner Corp., Mississauga, Ont., Canada) in order to provide a hairless skin sample; animals were rinsed thoroughly in warm water in order to ensure that all the Nair® lotion was removed.
Three to four mice (six in the case of the 1 and 48 h time points) were sacrificed by euthanizing with natural gas (propane) at each of 0.08, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, 6.0, 9.0, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h post injection.
An additional three mice were sacrificed without having been administered WST09 in order to provide WST09-free baseline values.
Terminal blood samples were obtained via cardiac puncture using a syringe coated with 0.1 mL of 3.2% (0.105 M) buffered sodium citrate solution (obtained from a sterile Vacutainer® tube, Becton-Dickinson Vacutainer Systems).
The volume of the blood obtained in each case was noted and the samples were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 2500 rpm at 4 °C.
100 μL of plasma was then added to 1 mL of Solvable®.
Samples of liver, kidney, depilated skin, leg adductor muscle, and tumour were obtained by dissection and rinsed in sterile saline.
Accurately weighed samples of each tissue were added to Solvable® in a volume ratio of 2 mL Solvable® per 100 mg of tissue and these, as well as the plasma samples, were placed in a 55 °C oven and allowed to digest for 24 h.
After digestion, the samples were stored in the dark at room temperature until analysis.
The entire analysis procedure was carried out under subdued light in order to prevent photodegradation of the WST09.
Calibration standards were made by dissolving WST09 in Solvable® to obtain a standard solution whose concentration was verified by UV-Vis spectroscopy.
2 mL calibration standards were then made by adding 100 mg of chicken breast (stored frozen and thawed just prior to use) to appropriate volumes of standard solution and Solvable®.
The standards were placed in a 55 °C lab oven for 24 h in order to allow for complete tissue digestion.
Calibration standards were used to construct calibration plots during GFAAS analysis.
Since tissue causes a light scattering effect, the inclusion of tissue in the calibration standards was deemed necessary.
The use of chicken breast to mimic the scattering effect of mouse tissues has been previously validated15.
In order to check stability, the standards were analysed for palladium content on days 1, 2, 3, and 7 post preparation.
Standards were stored in the dark, at room temperature for the duration of the study.
Absorbance peak area of palladium in solutions of 50 mg chicken tissue per mL of Solvable® was found to vary linearly with Pd concentration in the region of 5 to 95 ng mL−1 and the solutions as well as the instrument readings were found to be stable for up to 7 days.
A calibration curve was obtained each day sample analysis was performed.
Calibration standards and tissue samples were analyzed using a Unicam 939 Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrometer with a Unicam 247.6 nm (palladium atomic absorption line) hollow cathode lamp and a coated, ridged, graphite cuvette.
A deuterium source was used for background correction and absorbance peak area was measured.
The coated graphite cuvette was changed every 110 firings because of cuvette aging effects noted during previous method validation.15
Twenty microlitres of unknown sample or calibration standard were injected directly into the graphite cuvette without further preparation.
Three replicate measurements of the absorbance peak area were routinely obtained from each sample, from which the mean absorbance value and standard deviation were obtained.
Calibration curves were obtained as described above in order to permit determination of palladium content (ng mL−1 Solvable®) of the unknowns based on the equation of the best linear fit line of the calibration plot.
The concentration of palladium (and corresponding concentration of WST09 based on the mass fraction of palladium in WST09) per gram tissue or mL of plasma were then calculated from the concentration of palladium in each sample and known amount of tissue added to the digestion solution (molar ratio of palladium atom to the WST09 macrocycle is 1 ∶ 1).
The limit of detection of WST09 by this method has been determined elsewhere to be 330 ng g−1 in skin, 360 ng mL−1 in plasma, and 610 ng g−1 in liver, kidney, tumour, and muscle respectively15.
The mean concentration of WST09 in each tissue was plotted logarithmically versus time.
Assuming a two-compartment open model, the bi-exponential curves that best fit the data were determined using the method of residuals.17
In each case, the distribution and elimination rate constants (kα and kβ) were obtained graphically from each drug concentration versus time plot.
The highest drug concentration observed following administration, and the time at which it is observed (Cmax and tmax), were determined directly from the concentrations measured at each time point.
The area under the drug concentration versus time curve, both from time zero to infinity (AUC0-∞), and from time zero to the time at which the last quantifiable value was measured (AUC0-tlast), were calculated through application of the trapezoidal rule.17
Infinity was taken to be the clearance time, or the time at which 99.9% of the initial concentration of the drug was cleared from the tissues (as determined by extrapolation of the terminal elimination phase).
The rate of total clearance of the drug (Cl) was calculated as the dose (μg WST09 injected) divided by the area under the drug concentration versus time plot (AUC0-∞).
The apparent volume initial distribution (Vd) was calculated as the dose (μg WST09 injected) divided by the concentration of WST09 in the plasma when the concentration versus time plot was extrapolated back to zero. .
The pharmacokinetic distribution of WST09 in the plasma and tissues at 0.08, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, 6.0, 9.0, 12.0, 24.0, 48.0, 72.0 and 96.0 h post intravenous injection was determined using GFAAS.
The mean and standard deviation of the concentration of WST09 present in plasma and each tissue at each time point tested are given below in Table 1.
WST09 accumulation was not observed in skin, muscle, or tumour at any time.
This lack of accumulation indicates that direct tumour cell kill would not be possible using this drug.
However, local irradiation of the tumour area shortly following iv administration of the drug will potentially target the tumour vasculature.
This treatment approach has been demonstrated with positive results using bacteriochlorophyll-serine18,19 as well as uncoupled bacteriochlorophyll.3
The lack of accumulation in the peritumoural skin and muscle may contribute to the selectivity of the resulting tumour destruction if such a technique is employed, especially if the tumour is the most highly vascularized of the three tissues.
The lack of accumulation in the skin also makes unwanted phototoxicity unlikely.
The level of WST09 in the plasma (Fig. 2) was measured to be maximal (19 μg mL−1) at the earliest time point tested, i.e. 5 minutes post injection.
Considering the small size of the mouse and the fact that circulation time is rapid, the level of WST09 in the plasma is actually very likely maximized within seconds of the delivery of the bolus dose.
Furthermore, clearance from the plasma is rapid, with the concentration of WST09 decreasing to zero within three hours of injection.
Therefore, if the vasculature is the intended target, the plasma data support an irradiation time immediately post iv injection of the WST09 in order to take advantage of maximal intravascular concentrations of the drug.
Initially high levels of WST09 (Cmax equal to 43 μg g−1 at 5 minutes post injection) are present in the liver that steadily decrease up to 24 h post injection (Fig. 3).
This affinity for the reticuloendothelial organs is typical of lipophilic drugs and represents the binding of the drug to high density lipoprotein (HDL) in the serum and its clearance via the bile-gut pathway.20–24
WST09 is also found to be present in the kidney (Cmax equal to 8.1 μg g−1 at 5 minutes post injection) with the levels decreasing to zero at 9 h post injection (Fig. 4).
The concentration of WST09 in the kidney is substantially less than that of the liver, consistent with clearance via the bile gut pathway.
The relatively rapid clearance of the drug from the liver and kidney reduces the risk of unwanted systemic toxicity.
The kinetic results indicate biphasic kinetics for plasma, kidney, and liver.
The existence of a distribution phase in the plasma data was postulated based on only two data points (0.08 and 0.25 h) and therefore the delineation of this phase may be subject to considerable error.
The application of a two-compartment open model was assumed to be correct based on the biphasic kinetics exhibited in the liver and kidney.
However, due to the dynamic equilibrium that exists between the amount of drug present in the plasma and tissues, biphasic kinetics are also expected in the plasma.
Therefore, discounting the existence of the initial fast distribution phase in the plasma would likely have introduced a greater margin of error than that incurred through the determination of the elimination phase using such a small number of data points.
Analysis of the pharmacokinetic and distribution characteristics in each tissue was performed using a two compartment open model.
The results of this analysis are shown in Table 2.
In each of plasma, kidney, and liver, tmax was observed at the earliest time point taken, i.e., 5 minutes post injection.
Relatively rapid clearance was observed in plasma, kidney and liver.
The total rate of clearance and the apparent volume of distribution were calculated to be 11 mL h−1 and 0.9 mL respectively.
This small volume of initial distribution is consistent with the drug initially distributing only within the plasma and blood-rich tissues.
This is what was expected based on the lack of drug found in the non-blood-rich tissues, and supports the view that the initial linear portion of the drug concentrations versus time curve for plasma was extrapolated correctly despite the small number of data points present.
The goal of this study was the determination of the pharmacokinetic profile of WST09 in an EMT6 tumour-bearing Balb/c mouse model for the purpose of determining its tumour selectivity.
Based on the results obtained by GFAAS, WST09 appears to be efficiently cleared from the plasma and tissues of this model via the liver and kidney.
The drug does not appear to accumulate in the skin, muscle, or tumour indicating that vascular targeting is most likely necessary for the effective use of this drug in PDT.
Furthermore, due to the rapid clearance of WST09 from the plasma, irradiation should be carried out immediately after intravenous injection in order to take advantage of maximal intravascular drug concentration.

Investigation of the protonation site in the dialanine peptide by infrared multiphoton dissociation spectroscopy
Protonated dialanine cations have been isolated in a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass-spectrometer (FT-ICR-MS) and subjected to infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) at the free electron laser facility CLIO in Orsay (France).
The spectral dependence of the IR induced fragmentation pattern in the mid-infrared region (800–2000 cm−1) is interpreted with the help of structure and vibrational spectrum calculations of the different protonated conformers.
This comparison allows for the assignment of the proton on the terminal amino group, as the most favourable proton site, the neighbouring amide bond being in the trans conformation.
Identification of proteins is routinely performed by means of mass-spectrometry.
Following proteolysis, a tryptic digest peptide fragment can be introduced in the gas phase and ionised, either by means of electrospray ionisation (ESI) or by matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation (MALDI), and then submitted to fragmentation.
The peptide fragment mass-fingerprint then leads to the protein primary sequence.
Collision induced dissociation (CID) is a very efficient process for deposition of energy in an isolated peptide cation leading to its fragmentation.1–5
According to the peptide cation sequence, different fragmentation patterns are observed and several authors have contributed to the development of a “mobile proton model” which aims to explain those cleavage patterns.6–8
In this model, it is assumed that before energy deposition, a proton is tightly bound by the peptide in its lowest energy configuration at a basic site (e.g. at the N-terminal or on a side-chain).
Following excitation, the proton then explores different excited configurations that become populated and cleavage takes place once it is located on a backbone site.
For example, as recently reviewed in ref. 9 different (b or y) cations are produced whether the positive charge remains on the N terminal fragment or on the C terminal.
Understanding gas-phase dissociation mechanisms is useful for improving procedures which are used in peptide sequencing and protein identification by means of mass spectrometry.7
It has recently been shown that gas-phase conformations can strongly influence peptide fragmentation.10
We consider here a method that provides enough energy to induce protonated peptide fragmentation and that leads to structural information about the initial intact gas-phase peptide cations.
Those protonated ions, produced by MALDI, are first stored and mass-selected in a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FT-ICR-MS).
They are further submitted to infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) and the fragment ion yields are recorded as a function of the IR excitation energy.11
IRMPD requires the use of a laser source of high peak fluence of infrared photons, which can be tuned over the different vibrational absorption lines.
A high repetition rate is also required for multiple photon absorption leading to dissociation during ion trapping times.
These conditions are well fulfilled by infrared free electron lasers (FEL) as recently demonstrated at FELIX12 and CLIO.11
Some important points must be stressed concerning this technique.
Although cations are produced by MALDI, at high internal energies of about 1500 K, they are trapped in the ICR cell for a few seconds (2 s in the present experiments) before exposure to the IR radiation.
Thus, they have enough time to substantially relax towards room temperature, as has been shown by the extensive work of Ho and Dunbar on the radiative relaxation time constants for cations of similar size and similar initial excess internal energies.13
In the present IRMPD experiments, the first IR photon is then absorbed by cations that present a low density of vibrational states.
This first step is resonant and its spectral dependence is thus characteristic of the initial cation conformations at room temperature, as usual in IR absorption spectroscopy.
This first amount of added energy is then rapidly redistributed over the different coupled modes and further absorption of IR photons leads to fragmentation, due to progressive heating, in a very similar fashion as compared to multiple collision activation (MCA–CID).1–5
Direct absorption infrared spectroscopy of cations would be very difficult due to the extremely small ion densities obtainable in mass spectrometers and one here takes advantage of the high sensitivity of fragment ion detection in FT-ICR-MS, in order to monitor the first resonant step.
However, one should not expect a perfect matching between observed and calculated spectral fragmentation patterns.
For calculating fragmentation spectra, it is assumed for simplicity that only the resonant initial excitation step has to be taken into account.
While absorption frequencies can be determined with a reasonable accuracy by means of DFT (Density Functional Theory), which is the most accessible method for such mid-size molecular systems, intensities are not so well predicted.14
Moreover, for fragmentation, this first step is necessarily followed by multiple absorption within a quasi-continuum where vibrational transitions can be slightly red-shifted and broadened due to anharmonic couplings.15
Up to now, different methods have been used for the determination of protonation sites of peptides.
Experimentally, one can study deprotonation reactions of investigated peptides by reference compounds16 or hydrogen/deuterium exchange reactions.17
Those studies are usually complemented by quantum chemistry calculations, which provide low-energy equilibrium structures and protonation energetics.3,6
In the present work, we would like to show that IR spectroscopy can also bring valuable information on the protonation sites of peptides ions, isolated in the gas-phase and close to thermal equilibrium at room temperature.
The results reported here concern the protonated dialanine cation, Ala–Ala–H+, whose fragmentation pattern has been thoroughly studied, in MCA–CID experiments.1,4
This cation already possesses several conformers, similar to those encountered in larger protonated peptides, with different protonation sites.
However, its small size (24 atoms), and its very simple methyl side-chains, allows for a rather easy exploration of its whole potential energy surface (PES), with still simple computational means.
We also take advantage of the detailed theoretical study of the very similar protonated diglycine, previously performed by Suhai et al.6,8
After a description of the experimental procedure, spectral dependencies of IRMPD fragmentation yields will be discussed with the help of calculation of the different Ala–Ala–H+ cation structures and their simulated vibrational spectra.
IRMPD of Ala–Ala–H+ cations has been studied in a home-built compact FT-ICR-MS, MICRA, which has been described in detail elsewhere.18
This spectrometer has a permanent magnet producing a magnetic field of 1.25 T, allowing for a mass-range of 10 to 1000 amu, and its mass-resolution is better than 30 000 at mass 161 of the studied cations.
Those Ala–Ala–H+ cations were produced by a MALDI technique: racemic dialanine (dl–Ala–dl–Ala from Aldrich) was mixed with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) as the matrix, in a 1∶1 mass ratio, and compressed into a 1 mm thick pellet.
A 4 × 4 mm piece of this pellet was then glued on a steel holder, which was mounted just outside the ICR, 6 mm away from a trapping plate.
The cations entered the ICR cell collinearly with the magnetic field through a 5 mm diameter hole.
The target holder was maintained at 1.8 V, while a 3.5 V potential was applied to the trapping plates, so as to optimise the ion signals.
Furthermore, synchronised with the pulsed laser output at the YAG third harmonic wavelength, the potential of the entrance trapping plate was pulsed down to 0 V for about 25 μs, in order to allow for ion entrance into the cell.
As outlined above, these cations initially possess a large amount of internal energy and thus fragment.
They were thus allowed to internally relax, close to room temperature, either by collisions with the background gas (few 10−8 Torr) or by radiative decay, over 2 s.
Cations with the mass of interest, i.e. 161 amu, were then mass-selected, by ejection of all other ions, before IR irradiation.
Fragmentation was then resonantly induced by IRMPD.
The electron accelerator of the FEL CLIO facility was set at 44 MeV and a continuously tunable laser beam was obtained between 800 and 2000 cm−1 with a bandwidth of about 10 cm−1.
A train of 25 macropulses s−1 was sent into the trap during 2 s after cation selection.
One macropulse contained 500 micropulses, each of them of a few picoseconds duration, separated by 16 ns.
During the present experiments, the measured mean laser power was stable around 800 mW, at 9 μm, thus corresponding to energies of 32 mJ macropulse−1 or 64 μJ micropulse−1.
At 5 μm, the laser power was only 380 mW.
However, in the present experiments, this FEL beam was attenuated by a factor of 3, using one attenuator, in order to avoid saturation.
The laser beam entered the vacuum chamber perpendicular to the magnetic field through a ZnSe window.
It was mildly focused with a one-meter focal length spherical mirror and the beam waist was estimated to be about 0.3 mm at 5 μm, i.e. smaller than the size of the ion cloud.18
Considering the variation of the waist as a function of the laser wavelength, the IR fluence can be estimated to be about the same from 5 to 9 μm.
Thus, considering the complex multiphoton character of the IRMPD process, no fluence correction has been applied and the raw IRMPD spectra are provided here and compared to calculated absorption spectra.
The observed mass spectra are very simple and similar to those obtained in the high-pressure regime of CID experiments,1 which corresponds to multiple-collision activation.
Before IR irradiation or for a FEL wavelength outside the absorption bands, the main peaks correspond to mass 161, i.e. intact protonated dialanine, and to masses 189, 172 and 146, i.e. parent and fragment cations from the CHCA matrix.
Another small peak corresponds to mass 44, i.e. the well-known immonium a1 ion H2N+CH–CH3 that is always observed for alanine-containing peptides.1
Two other small peaks appear at masses 70 and 187, corresponding to masses 44 and 161 plus an additional mass 26.
When IRMPD occurs, no spectral fingerprint is observed for any of these ions except for the parent (161) and immonium fragment (44) ions.
The former displays spectral depletion that corresponds to a simultaneous increase of the fragment signals.
Thus we present here the fragmentation yield as corresponding to mass 44 fragment signals divided by the sum of the fragment and parent cation signals, as plotted as a function of the FEL photon energy in Fig. 1.
This spectrum is dominated by three groups of absorption bands: a first one with two peaks at 1130 and 1170 cm−1, a second one with several peaks at 1375, 1400, 1460 and 1525 cm−1, and a last double peak at 1700 and 1760 cm−1.
Despite the laser attenuation, the fragmentation yield is quite high and amounts to up to 60% for the first peaks.
From the shape of the first and the last three peaks, it can be estimated that the full width at half maximum (FWHM) is about 40 cm−1, for each individual absorption line.
A similar bandwidth had been obtained in the case of organometallic complexes,11 protonated benzenes19 and sodiated amino acids,15 which were recorded with a similar experimental procedure.
Since the laser bandwidth is only about 10 cm−1, this experimental line width is probably mainly due to the rotational bandwidth of the ions at room temperature, as it is observed for similar neutral molecular species in the gas phase.20
However, we cannot exclude some additional broadening due to some remaining saturation or due to the multiphoton process.
Infrared absorption spectra of different low-lying energy configurations of the AlaAla–H+ cation have been calculated in order to assign the IRMPD fragmentation patterns.
As already stated above, different sites are available for the excess proton and several conformations must be considered for each of them.
An exploration of the PES of the protonated dialanine cation has been carried out using the conformational search algorithm implemented in HyperChem 7.0 (Hypercube Inc.).
Here we use the same nomenclature as in the study of protonated diglycine.6
The site of protonation is indicated by A for the N-terminal amino group or O for the carbonyl oxygen of the amide CO group.
Here we consider only A and O protonation sites since the PES of protonated dialanine is expected to be very similar to that of protonated diglycine, as calculated by Suhai et al.6
In this case, conformers protonated at the nitrogen atom of the amide group (D) and diol-like conformers (G), originating from protonation at the acidic CO group, lie more than 10 kcal mol−1 above the A and O conformers and are thus very unlikely to be populated at 300 K. We indeed calculated that the lowest D conformer lies more than 12 kcal mol−1 above the most stable conformer in the present dialanine case.
The conformational search was performed at the AM1 semi-empirical level.
For both A and O isomers, we explored the PES along all the torsion (dihedral) angles of the peptide backbone and the O–H bond orientations.
About 20 local minima, lying within 10 kcal mol−1 above the absolute minimum, were selected as starting points for full structure optimisations at the hybrid density functional B3LYP/6-31G* level, using the Gaussian 03 package.21
Subsequent (harmonic) frequency calculations were also performed, in order to check for actual minima and to obtain the corresponding IR frequencies.
Calculated relative energies of the lowest conformers, including the zero-point-energy (ZPE) and the thermal energy at 298 K, are provided in Table 1 together with the energies relative to the most stable A1 conformer.
In order to check the validity of the present calculation level, we also performed single point B3LYP/6-31++G** energy calculations, at the B3LYP/6-31G* geometry.
The results are also given in Table 1 for the eleven most stable conformers.
With these larger basis set calculations, the corresponding relative energetics of the low-lying conformers do not change much and are always within 0.7 kcal mol−1 with respect to the B3LYP/6-31G* results.
In the following, we will thus refer only to these results.
We also give the backbone (Ψ, ω, ϕ) and OH (α, β) orientation torsion angle values that have been used in the conformational search, again with the same nomenclature as in the diglycine study.6
Fig. 2 displays the four lowest calculated equilibrium structures of AlaAla–H+.
Among the lowest-energy conformers, A1/A2/A3 and O1/O2/O3 conformers are similar, in geometry and in relative energies, to those calculated for protonated diglycine.6
In particular, they correspond to a trans conformation of the amide bond, i.e.ω values close to 180°.
However, for each of them, we found some additional minima, denoted in Table 1 by ‘or’ symbols, which correspond to some variations in the torsion angles.
More importantly, we also found additional minima corresponding to a cis conformation of the amide bond, i.e.ω values close to 0°.
These equilibrium structures were not considered for the protonated diglycine ion although one of them, the cisA3 conformer in the present study, lies only 1.63 kcal mol−1 above the lowest conformation A1.
We must however outline that the trans–cis isomerisation is highly improbable since the corresponding barrier is expected to be very high.
We indeed calculated that the barrier height between transA1 and cisA3 conformers is more than 1 eV (24.2 kcal mol−1).
For comparison, the calculated barrier height values, for the trans conformations, are only 3.2 kcal mol−1 between A1 and O1 and 2.5 kcal mol−1 between A1 and A2.
In the matrix, dialanine molecules are expected to be initially in the regular trans conformation.
When produced by MALDI, protonated ions are created with high internal energies, typically of about kT ∼ 3 kcal mol−1 per mode at an estimated temperature of about 1500 K. From the above isomerisation barriers, it is thus expected that only trans ion conformations can be formed.
After being cooled down close to 300 K, the mean cation internal energy per mode is decreased to kT ∼ 0.6 kcal mol−1 and the relevant energetic quantities are the free energies.
The present calculated (harmonic) free energy differences with respect to A1 are 2.21 kcal mol−1 for O1 and 1.59 kcal mol−1 for A2 conformers.
From the above isomerisation barriers and energy differences, it is thus expected that the trans conformer populations should be in the order A1 ≫ A2 > O1.
Other conformers lie at too high energies (about 3 kcal mol−1 or more, with respect to A1) to be noticeably present at room temperature.
These theoretical predictions are discussed below from the comparison between the experimental spectrum and the simulated spectra.
For the four lowest calculated conformers, transA1, cisA3, transA2 and transO1, the corresponding predicted IR absorption spectra in the 800–2000 cm−1 range are presented in Fig. 3.
Those simulated spectra have been obtained by using the regular scaling factor of 0.9614,22 for the calculated harmonic vibrations at the present level of theory.
Furthermore, calculated stick spectra have been convoluted with a 40 cm−1 wide (FWHM) Lorentzian profile, in order to better simulate the experimental spectrum.
The comparison between those simulated spectra and the experimental spectrum leads us to the conclusion that the observed conformer must correspond mainly to a transA geometry.
The best fit to the experimental spectrum indeed corresponds to conformer transA1, while conformer transA2 also matches quite well.
In those cases, the theoretical line positions correspond nicely to peaks in the IRMPD absorption spectrum, particularly in the region above 1300 cm−1, while A1 appears to perform slightly better than A2 in the region 1000–1200 cm−1.
However, in both cases and at least below 1500 cm−1, the line intensities are clearly not as good as the line positions.
These discrepancies in the line intensities could be due either to the rather rough theoretical method employed here or, as discussed in the introduction, to the IRMPD process itself.
The cisA3 conformer can be clearly ruled out.
First, it displays only one intense peak at 1725 cm−1 instead of two at 1700 and 1760 cm−1 in the experimental spectrum.
Second, this conformer spectrum does not display any intense peak around 1525 cm−1 whereas a quite large IRMPD fragmentation is observed at this energy.
The transO1 conformer can also be ruled out because of the discrepancies again at 1700 cm−1, where two peaks are present but too much separated at 1680 and 1760 cm−1.
Furthermore, around 1400 cm−1, calculated absorption bands are much too weak as compared to the experimental data.
We have also checked that, for the following higher energy conformers, such, or even worse, discrepancies are observed.
We can thus conclude that, in protonated dialanine, protonation occurs on the terminal amino group, corresponding either to the transA1 or the transA2 conformers.
This is in good agreement with the above theoretical predictions, from the calculated conformer energetics.
However, only more refined calculations and better-resolved experimental data could provide more information on all conformer populations at room temperature.
From the IRMPD spectrum of the protonated dialanine cation, as compared to standard quantum chemistry calculations, we conclude that the favoured protonation site is the terminal amino group, at least at low internal energies close to room temperature.
We found that the IRMPD spectrum matches with those of the two low-energy conformers corresponding to this protonation site.
These two conformers were predicted to be within the four lowest energy isomers of the system and, for both of them, the adjacent amide bond is in the regular trans conformation.
The lowest energy conformer A1 corresponds to an almost planar geometry of the peptide backbone (all torsion angles close to 180°).
It differs from the second one A2 in only one torsion angle, the Camide–N–C–Cacid dihedral angle that is close to 90°, leading the acidic group to be almost perpendicular to the beginning of the peptide backbone.
From this comparison and from the calculated energetics, it is concluded that all other conformers, such as cis conformations of the amide bond or protonation sites on the amide oxygen, do not noticeably contribute to the experimental IR spectrum.
Additional information, obtained from other parts of the IR spectrum, and more refined energetic and frequency calculations of the low-lying equilibrium structures, may help to obtain a more quantitative agreement between the calculated and experimental spectra.
It seems that the present technique may be limited to relatively small systems (several tens of atoms) so that only few low-energy conformers contribute to the experimental spectrum, which can still retain some characteristic sharp features, and so that accurate quantum chemistry calculations can still be performed, over the whole low-energy part of the PES.
The IRMPD technique is however a unique tool for studying the main structures of isolated molecular or complex ions of biological interest, at a well-defined thermodynamic temperature.
The comparison with theoretical calculations is made much easier than for condensed phase data, because of the absence of solvent effects.
Other data obtained on different small protonated peptides will be reported soon and future experiments should also concern negative ions such as nucleotides or sulfated monosaccharides.
Validation of density functional methods for computing structures and energies of mercury(iv) complexes
While quantum chemical predictions have strongly suggested a decade ago the existence of mercury in its oxidation state +iv, no experimental evidence has been found yet.
To enable the search for alternative targets and preparation routes by quantum chemical methods, the present work has validated density functional methods against accurate CCSD(T) results for structures, reaction energies and activation barriers for X2-elimination, and atomization energies for three HgX4 systems (X = F, Cl, H).
Hybrid functionals with ca. 20% Hartree–Fock exchange like B3LYP, B1LYP or MPW1PW91 have provided the best energetics, whereas local or gradient-corrected “pure” functionals overestimate, and the BHandHLYP hybrid functional underestimates the stability of the HgIV state.
Basis sets are suggested that provide a reasonable compromise between accuracy and computational effort in calculations on larger systems.
The possible existence of species with mercury in an oxidation state higher than +ii has been puzzling experimentalists and theoreticians for almost three decades.
An experimental verification of such high-valent mercury complexes is a fascinating target, as it would turn a group 12 element into a true transition metal.
An initial report of an electrochemically generated, spectroscopically characterized short-lived [Hg(iii)(cyclam)][BF4]2 species by Deming et al. in 19761 has never been confirmed.
But it stimulated Jørgensen2,3 to predict the possible existence of HgF4.
Analogous to the 5d8 AuIII oxidation state, a 5d8 HgIV species should be more stable than a HgIII d9 state.
In 1993, we reported the first application of quantum chemical methods to the problem.4,5
Using high-level quasirelativistic pseudopotential QCISD(T) calculations with, at the time, respectable basis sets, the square-planar D4h symmetrical HgF4 was predicted to be thermodynamically stable in the gas phase with respect to the elimination reaction HgF4 → HgF2 + F2 (see Fig. S1 of electronic supplementary information (ESI) for transition state).
Comparison with nonrelativistic pseudopotential results showed that the stability of the higher oxidation state is of relativistic origin.5
Most notably, the results showed that a better description of electron correlation should increase the reaction energy.
This was confirmed five years later by Liu et al6. using larger basis sets and CCSD(T) methods.
HgCl4 was in contrast suggested to be thermodynamically unstable6 with respect to Cl2 elimination.
Seth et al. predicted that the eka-mercury analogue of HgF4, (112)F4, should be even more stable than HgF4 with respect to F2 elimination.7
Recently, Pyykkö et al8. showed computationally that HgH4 and HgH6 are significantly endothermic, but have moderate activation barriers to H2 elimination.
Up to date, none of the discussed high-valent mercury compounds systems has been confirmed experimentally.
The technical difficulties for their synthesis have apparently been too large.
As aggregation energies disfavor HgF4 against HgF2 in the condensed phase, molecular beam or matrix isolation techniques would seem appropriate.
However, the use of aggressive fluorine compounds and of mercury does not make the former route attractive for experimentalists, and the latter route also has not produced evidence for high-valent mercury.9
The quest for Hg(iv) complexes remains thus a major challenge, and we have recently started to consider new synthetic targets and routes, including electrochemical access using chelate or macrocyclic ligands and/or oxidizing matrix environments.10
A problem arising with quantum chemical predictions is that the accurate coupled-cluster methods employed previously in this field are computationally too expensive to be applied to larger complexes.
The only alternative is currently to use density functional theory (DFT) methods.
However, as the accuracy of the various DFT approaches may not be improved systematically towards the exact result, and the most appropriate functional is not immediately obvious, it is necessary to validate DFT methods on smaller models, for which accurate coupled cluster methods may still be used.
In this work we provide such a systematic validation study of various density functionals and basis sets on structures and stability of small HgX4 complexes (X = F, Cl, H; n = 2, 4) against accurate benchmark CCSD(T) calculations.
The benchmark calculations employed the coupled-cluster method with single and double, as well as perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T) level].
For comparison, CCSD and MP2 calculations are also reported.
All of these ab initio calculations used a quasirelativistic small-core 20-valence-electron (20-VE) pseudopotential11 (effective-core potential, ECP) with a (11s10p9d4f3g)/[9s6p5d3f2g] valence basis set11 for Hg, as well as aug-cc-pVQZ12,13 basis sets for F, Cl, and H. This ECP/basis-set combination will be denoted basis A. Bond lengths were optimized by fitting a fifth-order polynomial to about 7 single-point energy calculations, which were done with the MOLPRO 2000114. program.
DFT calculations used the Gaussian 9815 program and gradient methods.
The following exchange-correlation functionals were scrutinized: The local density approximation in form of the SVWN516 functional, the gradient-corrected BP8617,18 functional, and the hybrid functionals B1LYP,19,20 B3LYP15 (based on the work of Becke),21 MPW1PW91,22 and BHandHLYP.23
Basis-set requirements in the DFT calculations are expected to be somewhat less dramatic than in the post-HF treatments.
Moreover, future applications to larger systems require a reasonable compromise between accuracy and computational effort.
Three different basis-set combinations were compared, denoted B, C, and D (see Table 1).
We will in the following report the computational levels by the notation method/basis.
Unrestricted Kohn–Sham calculations on nonspherical atoms were performed to obtain atomization energies.
Basis-set superposition errors (BSSE) were considered using the counterpoise correction (CP)24 at optimized minimum structures.
Zero-point energy (ZPE) corrections were computed at the B3LYP/C level.
Spin–orbit corrections were not considered in this study.
They have previously been found to be small for the elimination reaction HgF4 → HgF2 + F2,5 and the theory against theory comparison is not affected by them.
The HgX4 systems were generally found to have D4h minima at all computational levels.
The calculated Hg–X bond lengths are shown in Table 2.
Using the CCSD(T)/A results as benchmark, CCSD/A underestimates the bond lengths for HgH4 and HgF4.
MP2/A overestimates the distances for HgF4 but underestimates them for HgCl4 and HgH4.
The large and non-systematic differences document the previously discussed5 importance of non-dynamical correlation in these systems, particularly for HgF4 and HgCl4.
The non-iterative triple excitations in CCSD(T) are known to partially recover the non-dynamical correlation.25
The CCSD T1-diagnostics26 at the CCSD(T) minima are 0.017, 0.011, and 0.012 for HgF4, HgCl4, and HgH4, respectively.
This suggests a reasonable quality of the coupled-cluster results.
The largest T1 value for HgF4 is consistent with large variations between MP2, CCSD, and CCSD(T) results.
This suggests to view MP2 and CCSD energies with caution.5
Compared to the CCSD(T)/A benchmark results, all DFT calculations overestimate the Hg-X bond lengths (see Table 2).
This may in part be due to the neglect of dispersion effects27 in present-day functionals, which would further decrease the distances.
Consistent with this, the discrepancies are by far largest for HgCl4.
Among the various functionals, the BHandHLYP and SVWN5 results are closest to the CCSD(T) values for HgF4 and HgCl4.
While this may be attributed to error compensation with the typical overbinding of the local density approximation for the SVWN5 case,28 the large fraction of Hartree–Fock exchange shortens the bond lengths for the BHandHLYP functional.
As might be expected, basis B provides the shortest DFT bond lengths and thus the best agreement with the benchmark CCSD(T)/A results.
This is largely due to the inclusion of f-functions for mercury and in part to the still relatively flexible basis sets for X. Basis set C provides results similar to basis set B for HgF4 and HgH4 at lower computational cost.
The results indicate that the best DFT structure results for HgX4 are obtained using basis sets B or C, and SVWN5 or BHandHLYP functionals.
Calculated energies for the elimination reactions HgX4 → HgX2 + X2 (X = F, Cl, H) are provided in Table 3 and in Fig. 1.
CCSD underestimates and MP2 overestimates the elimination energies in all cases.
This appreciable level dependence of the results indicates again a significant influence of non-dynamical correlation.
As has been discussed previously,5 these effects arise mainly for the “true transition-metal” HgIV d8 species, while non-dynamical correlation effects are much smaller for the HgII d10 complexes, where metal d-orbitals are unimportant for the bonding (see atomization energies below and in Table 5).
The resulting lack of error compensation between these effects for the two sides of the reaction is responsible for the appreciable level dependence.
Comparison with previous results5,6 confirms the notion of larger elimination reactions for larger basis sets.
The full CP procedure to correct for BSSE was not possible at CCSD(T)/A level for HgF4 and HgCl4, as the large dimension of the problem combined with the low symmetry of the CP calculation for the halogen atoms exceeded the available computational resources.
Given the close agreement between CCSD and CCSD(T) CP corrections for the hydride, we may assume that the CCSD values provide also a good estimate for the CCSD(T) CP correction in the other two cases.
In general, the CP corrections tend to lower the reaction energies moderately by ca. 10–15 kJ mol−1.
We estimate this to be less than the underestimate of correlation effects due to basis-set incompleteness errors, which are expected to cause an underestimate of the reaction energies.5
We presume therefore, that the CCSD(T)/A values in Table 3 provide still lower bounds to the true reaction energies.
Turning now to DFT methods, the best agreement with the benchmark CCSD(T)/A results is achieved using those hybrid functionals (B1LYP, B3LYP, and MPW1PW91) that exhibit about 20% Hartree–Fock (HF) exchange.
Functionals with higher HF exchange admixture, such as BHandHLYP (50% HF exchange) give too low elimination energies, whereas the gradient-corrected BP86, and in particular the local SVWN5 functional overestimate the elimination energies significantly.
The comparison of basis sets B, C, and D (Table 3 and Fig. 1) indicates a moderate basis-set dependence.
After inclusion of CP corrections, the intermediate basis C results are relatively close to those with the larger basis B (i.e., both provide good agreement with the CCSD(T) data when using a hybrid functional like B3LYP).
However, the CP corrections obtained for basis C are considerably larger than for basis B with HgF4 and HgH4, making basis B the overall more reliable method of choice, provided the size of system to be studied allows the use of the larger basis.
In particular, CP corrections are not easily applicable in all energy calculations (e.g. for intramolecular processes), and thus a basis with an inherently smaller BSSE may be preferable.
Finally, the basis D results for HgF4 and HgCl4 (including a segmented valence basis for Hg, cf. Table 1) exhibit large BSSE and still appreciable deviations from the basis B results after CP correction.
Zero-point energy (ZPE) corrections calculated at the B3LYP/C level are listed in Table 4.
The ZPE corrections lower the elimination energy almost negligibly for the fluoride and chloride and moderately so for the hydride.
Table 5 provides computed atomization energies (AE) for the X2, HgX2, and HgX4 systems (with CP corrections but without ZPE corrections).
These data allow us to further analyze the contributions from individual species to the elimination reactions in Table 3.
Triple excitations in the coupled cluster calculations increase the AE notably for HgF4, HgCl4, and for F2, consistent with nonnegligible non-dynamical correlation effects (see above).
In the same three cases, the MP2 calculations overestimate the AE appreciably.
In the other cases, the MP2 results are either somewhat above or slightly below the CCSD(T) data.
In the case of F2, Cl2, and H2, experimental data are available for comparison (see footnote a to Table 5).
The CCSD(T)/A results deviate only by a few kJ mol−1 from experiment, indicating an approximate convergence of the halogen (hydrogen) basis sets and of the correlation level in this case.
Any remaining errors in the CCSD(T)/A results for the elimination reactions (Table 3) will thus mostly be due to the description of the metal complexes themselves, probably in particular that of the HgIV species.
While any of the density functionals tested should perform reasonably well for the AE of H2 (the MPW1PW91/B results appear a bit low), the more complicated electronic structure of the dihalogens is reflected in larger variations between the functionals.
Again, hybrid functionals with ca. 20% Hartree–Fock exchange (B1LYP, B3LYP, MPW1PW91) tend to perform best (with an underestimate of ca. 10–30 kJ mol−1), whereas the BHandHLYP functional underestimates the AE of both F2 and Cl2 appreciably, and the gradient-corrected BP86 overestimates the AE for F2 (the local SVWN5 functional overestimates both AEs appreciably).
Similar behavior of the functionals is seen for the tetrahalide complexes: again B1LYP, B3LYP, and MPW1PW91 appear to perform best, BHandHLYP underbinds compared to the CCSD(T)/A benchmark results, whereas BP86 and particularly the local SVWN5 overbind appreciably.
In these cases, deviations for the tetrahalides are much larger than for the dihalides.
This translates into appreciable errors in the energies of the elimination reactions (cf. Table 3).
While the B3LYP/B AE are too high by ca. 70 and 60 kJ mol−1 for HgF4 and HgF2, respectively, these errors compensate largely for the elimination reaction.
Similar comparisons apply to the B1LYP and MPW91PW91 functionals.
In consequence, these types of hybrid functionals (with basis B) reproduce most reliably the CCSD(T)/A thermochemistry.
We have also attempted to calculate the transition states and activation barriers for the concerted elimination of X2 (Table 6).
Full structure optimization at the CCSD(T)/A level exceeded the available computational resources.
In the case of the post-HF methods, we were thus restricted to single-point energy calculations at various DFT-optimized structures.
Full optimizations were, however, attempted for all density functionals.
The transition states located are structurally similar to that computed for the HgH4 case by Pyykkö et al.,8 a planar arrangement with C2v symmetry (see supporting information).
For HgF4, the computed activation barriers appear to be very large and vary over a wide range (Table 6).
Already the variation of the structure with different functionals changes the CCSD(T)/A barrier over a range of more than 100 kJ mol−1.
The DFT barriers are only about half of the CCSD(T) results but still appear unrealistically large relative to the average Hg–F binding energies deducible from the atomization energies in Table 5.
Matters are less dramatic for HgCl4 and HgH4, where the computed barriers range from ca. 60 to 80 kJ mol−1, and from ca. 40 to 50 kJ mol−1, respectively.
In the latter two cases, the DFT results are not very far from the best CCSD(T) values.
Closer inspection of the electronic structure at the F2-elimination transition state for HgF4 suggests very small HOMO-LUMO gaps already for the hybrid functionals (ca. 1–1.7 eV for B3LYP, B1LYP, and MPW1PW91 and ca. 3–3.5 eV for BHandHLYP).
With gradient-corrected and local functionals, no electronically stable Kohn–Sham wavefunction could be obtained.
This suggests appreciable multi-reference character for the transition state, and both approximate DFT and single-reference coupled-cluster theory appear problematic.
Matters are not much better for the HgCl4 case (although here the BP86 and SVWN5 calculations afford small gaps of ca. 0.1–0.2 eV), and it is presently unclear why the computed barriers are less level dependent.
In contrast, the HgH4 case exhibits appreciable HOMO-LUMO gaps at any of the levels employed (ca. 4.5 eV with BP86 and SVWN5, ca. 6 eV with the “regular” hybrid functionals, and ca. 8 eV with BHandHLYP).
It appears that the simpler electronic structure of the HgH4 transition state, and possibly the relatively large Hg–H covalency, make this system an easier case for single-reference methods (T1 diagnostics at CCSD level in this case are only ca. 0.015, compared to values around 0.04–0.06 for HgF4 and HgCl4).
In particular, we think that repulsive effects between the nonbonding electron pairs of the halogen ligands and the 5p semi-core shell on mercury may be responsible29 for the generally larger non-dynamical correlation effects in the tetrahalides compared to the tetrahydride.
The present results for the HgH4 system agree well with the previous study by Pyykkö et al8.
This validation study of various density functionals and basis sets against accurate benchmark CCSD(T) results for structures and energetics of small HgIV complexes provides a basis for our ongoing studies10 on larger target systems of potential interest for experimental studies.
While relatively reliable structures of minima (except for HgCl4) may already be obtained with the local SVWN5 or the hybrid BHandHLYP functionals (due to error compensation), the energetics are better described by hybrid functionals like B1LYP, B3LYP, and MPW1PW91, that incorporate ca. 20% Hartree–Fock exchange.
The choice of basis sets will depend on the size of system to be studied.
Optimizations may employ the moderate-sized, economical basis C, whereas accurate DFT energy calculations may require the larger basis B that exhibits considerably lower BSSE.
A search for transition states and activation barriers for X2-elimination from HgX4 (X = F, Cl, H) indicated considerably larger multi-reference character for X = F, Cl than for the previously studied HgH4 system, possibly due to the presence of nonbonding electron pairs at the halogens.29
At least for X = F, no reliable activation barriers could thus be computed with the available methods.
Unfortunately, multi-configurational approaches would currently also be prohibitively expensive in this case, due to the large active orbital space that would be required.
However, based on the comparison with the other two cases, we expect an appreciable activation barrier for concerted F2-elimination, in view of the multi-reference character of the transition state probably the largest of the three systems studied.
In any case, the calculations confirm clearly the previously noted exothermic character of HgF4 as a gas phase species, in contrast to HgH4 and HgCl4.
Construction of a protein array on amyloid-like fibrils using co-assembly of designed peptides
Amyloid-like fibrils formed from de novo designed short peptides, made up a nanoscale scaffold on which streptavidin was arranged in a regular spacing, potentially allowing the development into an array technology utilizing bio-nanoconstructs.
The aggregation of proteins and peptides into amyloid fibrils is most commonly associated with a variety of fatal disease such as Alzheimer's disease and the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (prion diseases).1
Amyloid fibril is an undesirable state for proteins as biomolecules, however, it is a fascinating nanoconstruct because of its highly ordered quaternary structure in which numerous β-stranded polypeptide chains align regularly.2
Thus, this type of fibril has the potential to be engineered into novel proteinous nanoscale materials, and many fibrous proteins and peptides including of both natural and artificial origin have been investigated.3–7
We have previously demonstrated that de novo designed peptides undergo self-initiated structural transition and fibril formation, equipped with representative properties of amyloid.3a–d Cofibril formation from two, three or four peptide species with well-designed amino acid sequences was achieved, so that the charged residues within the β-strands were complementary to each other.3c,d This indicates a possibility of functionalising the fibrils by co-assembling of peptides with various elements to develop a fibrillar peptide material as a well-ordered nanoconstruct (Fig. 1).
Here, toward fabrication of a nanoscale array utilizing designed peptides, we report a protein (streptavidin) array immobilized on a fibrillar peptide assembly.
The biotinylated peptides were incorporated into the fibrils co-assembled with non-biotinylated peptides, allowing regular immobilization of streptavidin onto the fibrils.
The avidin-immobilized fibrils possibly make a nanoscaffold onto which a variety of functional groups are arranged.
The engineered fibrous peptides can be applied to develop arrays of chemical and biological molecules on the nanoscale construct.
We designed β16 and biotinylated B2x-β16 peptides8 that could assemble into amyloid-like fibrils according to the previous studies (Fig. 1).3a–d B2x-β16 peptide had a biotin group at the N-terminus as a streptavidin-binding domain.
When the peptide sequence was drawn as a β-sheet model, hydrophobic Leu residues and hydrophilic Glu and Lys residues were separated on the different faces, and the amphiphilic faces were inverted at the centre of β-strand.
Cofibril formation and the morphology of the designed peptides were analyzed by circular dichroism (CD) measurement, thioflavin T (ThT) binding assay, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
Biotinylated peptide (B2x-β16) was mixed with non-biotinylated peptide (β16) in a non-aggregated state in trifluoroethanol (in the molar ratio of 0–1% B2x-β16), and the peptide secondary structure was analyzed by CD measurements.
Both β16 alone and mixed peptides containing B2x-β16 formed a slightly α-helical ([θ]222 = −6500 deg cm2 dmol−1 for mixed peptide containing 1% B2x-β16), but predominantly a random coil structure shortly after dilution in 20 mM Tris·HCl buffer (pH 7.4).
Through the incubation at 50 °C, transformation to the β-sheet structure occurred time-dependently, as indicated by CD spectra with a negative peak at 219 nm and a positive peak at 203 nm ([θ]219 = −13 900 deg cm2 dmol−1 and [θ]203 = 54 200 deg cm2 dmol−1 for the mixed peptide containing 1% B2x-β16).
After the transition, ThT added to the peptide solutions exhibited strong fluorescence emission at 480 nm (excited at 440 nm).
ThT bound to amyloid fibrils is known to show characteristic fluorescence emission, and is widely used as a probe for amyloid fibrils.
The result of ThT binding assay indicates that the β-structural peptides form amyloid-like fibrils.
Direct observation of the peptide aggregates by TEM revealed that the peptides formed fibrillar structures (Fig. 2(a)).
The fibrils were ∼20 nm in width and of varying length (several hundred nanometers to several micrometers).
Specific introduction of streptavidin onto the matured fibrils was achieved using co-assembling fibrils with biotinylated peptides.
To pick out streptavidin under TEM observation, the streptavidin modified with colloidal gold (Au-Av: diameter of colloidal gold is 20 nm) was added to the matured fibrils (0–1% B2x-β16).9
No Au-Av was observed on the fibrils formed by β16 alone (containing no biotin), while attached Au-Av particles were observed on the fibrils containing B2x-β16 (Fig. 2(a)).
These results showed that biotinylated peptides were incorporated into fibrils, and streptavidin molecules attached to the biotin groups on the fibril.
Comparing with the cofibrils containing different ratios of B2x-β16 (1–0.01%), the quantity of Au-Av particles accumulated on the fibrils was inclined to become fewer, as the ratio of B2x-β16 became lower.
This suggests that there is a correlation between the mixing ratio of two peptides at a random coil state and the existence ratio of biotin in the formed fibrils.
The distance between successive Au-Av particles bound to the fibrils containing 1% B2x-β16 indicated that the gold particles were distributed preferably on average every 50, 100, 150 nm (Fig. 2(b)), suggesting a periodic binding of Au-Av particles on the fibrils at every ca.
50 nm.
The distance of hydrogen bonds between peptide strands is 4.7 Å along the fibril direction in the cross-β-sheet structure,2 and in the fibrils of our designed peptide with homologous sequence it was found to be 4.1 Å as elucidated by X-ray reflection.3c The average 40–50 nm intervals between Au-Av particles represent the distance about 100–120 peptides aligned along the fibril axis.
Hence, it can be ideally considered that one biotinylated peptide is preferably incorporated in every 100–120 peptides during fibrillogenesis.
However, the observed fibrils with ∼20 nm width are supposed to consist of several β-sheet filaments bundling regularly,2,5,6 because the 5–6 nm-length peptide of β16 (16 amino acid residues) makes a single filament of about 5 nm width, if the peptides align perpendicularly to the fibril axis.
The assumed structure suggests that distances between biotin groups along the fibril direction should be shorter than 50 nm if biotinylated peptides were incorporated every 100 peptides.
Despite this, Au-Av particles were bound every 50 nm in our experiment.
One of the possible explanations is that streptavidin would bind with plural biotin groups.
Sterptavidin has four binding sites for biotin, and would bind to plural biotin groups closely arranged in the fibrils, probably resulting in no observation of intervals less than 20 nm and in broad peaks in the histogram.
Another speculation is that biotin groups could be exposed enough to bind streptavidin every 50 nm.
Dobson et al. reported that periodic binding of anti-fluorescein IgG to cofibrils assembled from insulin and a partial short peptide from other protein labelled with fluorescein.7
The insulin cofibrils showed a regular helical twist every 60 nm along the fibril axis, and the antibodies bound to fluorescein exposed according to the structural periodicity of fibrils such as helical twist of the fibrils.
However, the binding of the antibody to other cofibrils made from two types of other short peptides with native sequences (with no distinct design in their sequences) did not show high periodicity.
On the other hand, in our experiments the periodic binding of avidin to the fibrils was demonstrated, although the fibrils were formed from short peptides.
Our results may arise from the purposefully designed peptide sequences considering the side-chain interactions to affect regular fibril formation.
We have previously demonstrated using de novo designed peptides that the intermolecular side-chain interactions such as ionic pairing, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interaction were constitutive for the fibril formation.3
The peptides used in this study were also well designed considering the matching of the side-chain interactions between antiparallel β-strands to regulate the fibril formation.
It is conceivable that the formed fibrils have a regularity or periodicity in the fine structure, although the direct evidence such as helical twist could not be found in TEM images.
In our speculation, the biotin groups in the fibrils were exposed to the aqueous environment according to the structural periodicity of fibrils determined by the side-chain interactions, leading to the periodic binding of avidin onto the fibrils.
The biotinylated peptides were quantitatively and randomly incorporated into the cofibrils.
Therefore, the frequency of bound Au-Av particles on the fibrils consequently reflects the structural periodicity of fibrils owing to the regular peptide alignment.
It is suggested that the arrangement of streptavidin on the peptide fibrils can be controlled using well-designed peptides.
In conclusion, we have succeeded in the arrayed immobilization of natural protein onto the fibrillar nanoconstruct formed from designed peptides.
Streptavidin was disposed regularly at intervals of 50 nm on the fibrils containing biotinylated peptides.
Other functional molecules can be arrayed onto the fibrils used in this study by adding functionalized streptavidin to biotinylated fibrils and/or adding functionalized biotin to streptavidin-immobilized fibrils.
In fact, the fluorophore-labelled avidin bound to the fibrils has enabled single fiber observation (data not shown).
Furthermore, engineered peptide fibrils formed from small peptides is of advantage, because the peptide element constructing fibrils can be easily modulated and modified by its amino acid composition,3e chain length, and incorporation of functional groups.
The present study implies that a variety of functional molecules can be immobilized on peptide nanofibrils in controlled distance and amount, thus indicating the possibility to design nanoscale bioconstructs with functionalities.
Efficient energy transfer between nanocrystalline YAG:Ce and TRITC
Luminescent nanocrystalline (NC) Ce3+-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Y3Al5O12:Ce–YAG:Ce) is prepared by a combustion synthesis technique that yields a highly porous three-dimensional network of interconnected 18 nm nanocrystals.
Tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC) was conjugated to NC YAG:Ce by using glycine as a bridging molecule.
Efficient energy transfer is observed from the Ce3+ ions to the TRITC molecules upon photoexcitation of the NC YAG:Ce–TRITC conjugates.
Resonant energy transfer (ET) between a donor in the excited state and a neighboring acceptor is commonly observed between dyes,1 quantum dots and dyes,2,3 quantum dots,4,5 and metal ions.6
The ET process can occur via several mechanisms, but the electric dipole–electric dipole interaction is the most effective one over relatively long distances (up to several tens of angstroms, with a r−6 distance dependence).6
This mechanism is particularly efficient when both donor and acceptor have allowed electric dipole resonant transitions.
ET between suitable probes can be used to obtain structural information or monitor dynamic processes in biological systems but its usefulness is severely limited by fast photobleaching when dyes are used for tagging the target molecules.
Semiconductor quantum dots are more stable than dyes7 but still suffer from photoinduced degradation processes.
Luminescent ions in inorganic phosphors offer the prospect of a greatly superior photo-stability associated with high quantum yields.
Intermittence in emission (blinking), which is a problem in certain applications of single quantum dots, is not expected for inorganic phosphor nanocrystals as they contain a large number of luminescing ions (typically between 10 and 10 000 depending on the size of the nanocrystal and the concentration of luminescing ions).
In the past few years there has been a growing interest in the properties of nanocrystalline lanthanide-doped insulating phosphors, and several well-known materials, such as Y2O3:Eu3+,8–10 Lu2O3:Eu3+,11 YVO4:Eu3+,12 LaPO4:Ln3+ (Ln = Eu or Ce/Tb13), YbPO4:Er3+,14 and Y3Al5O12:Ln3+ Ln = Nd, Eu, Tb, Tm or Ce15–19), have been prepared in nanocrystalline form.
The application of lanthanide-doped nanocrystalline phosphors as biological labels would however strongly limit the photon turnover rates due to the long (μs to ms) decay time of their intraconfigurational 4fn luminescence.
One of the few exceptions for visible-emitting phosphors is Y3Al5O12:Ce (YAG:Ce).
In YAG:Ce the 5d state of Ce3+ is situated at a low energy resulting in a fast intraconfigurational 5d → 4f luminescence in the visible.
The luminescence life time of this emission is 65 ns.20
This luminescence decay time is ideally suited for time-gated detection of biological species, since it is slower than the autofluorescence background decay common to many biological species (typically a few ns), but is still fast enough to ensure a high turnover rate.
Additional attractive features are the excitation in the blue (which further decreases the autofluorescence background obtained under UV excitation) and the large Stokes shift of the luminescence.
The strong electric dipole of the Ce3+ f–d emission also makes NC YAG:Ce a promising candidate as donor for efficient ET processes to dyes.
In order to evaluate the potentiality of NC YAG:Ce as a probe in biological systems the ET from NC YAG:Ce to tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC) was investigated.
TRITC is chemically conjugated to highly luminescent NC YAG:Ce by using glycine as a linker molecule.
Steady state (excitation and emission spectra), time-domain (fluorescence decay times) measurements and photobleaching experiments clearly demonstrate the occurrence of ET from Ce3+ to TRITC molecules in the NC YAG:Ce–TRITC conjugates.
Nanocrystalline YAG:Ce (0.5 mol%) was prepared by using a combustion synthesis technique similar to that reported in,10 but optimized to yield nanoparticles smaller than 20 nm with a small degree of sintering.
Glycine was used as a fuel and the metal nitrates as oxidizers.
Typically, 3 mmol of Ln(NO3)3·4H2O (Ln = Y and Ce), 5 mmol of Al(NO3)3·9H2O and 14 mmol of glycine were dissolved in 4 mL of demi-water and the resultant solution was dried overnight at 80 °C.
The resulting transparent gel was placed into a preheated furnace at 650 °C for 30 min in air.
The as-synthesized product was a foamy porous gray body, which was shown by X-ray powder diffraction to be amorphous.
This product was subsequently treated at 1150 °C for 90 s under air, yielding a highly porous yellow body.
Fig. 1 shows the X-ray powder diffraction patterns of the final product and of a microcrystalline powder sample of YAG:Ce (commercial phosphor purchased from Nichia Co.).
It can be concluded that the final product consists of single phase crystalline YAG.
The peak broadening and the small shift of the peak maxima to lower angles can be ascribed to a finite size effect, indicating that the sample consists of nanocrystalline domains.
The mean size of these domains, determined from the full width at half maximum of the peak with the Debye–Scherrer formula21 is 18 nm.
Thermal treatments at temperatures higher than 1150 °C and/or for longer times yield larger average nanocrystal sizes and more pronounced sintering.
Temperatures below 1000 °C yield amorphous white samples (non-luminescent).
The use of other fuels such as urea or citric acid leads to slightly larger YAG:Ce nanocrystals (23 nm), lower quantum yields and a larger degree of sintering.
The NC YAG:Ce samples are highly friable and can be easily ground to a powder and broken apart into NC clusters (100–1000 nm) by sonic waves (sonic bath).
The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of one such NC YAG:Ce cluster is depicted in Fig. 2A, which clearly shows that the NC YAG:Ce samples consist of a highly porous and interconnected three-dimensional network of nanoparticles.
The high degree of crystallinity of these YAG:Ce nanoparticles is confirmed by both high-resolution TEM (Fig. 2B) and selected area electron diffraction (inset of Fig. 2A).
The size of the YAG:Ce nanocrystals obtained from TEM and HR-TEM is consistent with the average size determined from XRD (∼20 nm).
To conjugate TRITC to NC YAG:Ce a portion of 35 mg NC YAG:Ce (a slightly yellow powder) in 10 mL ultra-pure water was mixed thoroughly with 35 mg glycine (aminoacetic acid) and left overnight.
Excess of glycine was removed by centrifuging and several times rinsing with ultra pure water.
Glycine was chosen as the linker molecule because it can bind to both TRITC and NC YAG:Ce.
The carboxylic group of glycine is expected to strongly bind to the surface of the YAG:Ce nanocrystals via the Y3+ and Al3+ ions, whereas its primary amine group reacts with the isothiocyanate group of TRITC.
The use of TRITC as functionalised dye allows for selective excitation of the YAG:Ce at 440 nm since the absorption of TRITC at this wavelength is very low.
A disadvantage of TRITC as a dye is the spectral overlap between the emission of YAG:Ce and TRITC which complicates a quantitative analysis of the energy transfer efficiency from the emission spectra.
To the glycine capped NC YAG:Ce 35 μg of TRITC in 10 mL methanol was added and the sample was left overnight.
The excess of TRITC was removed by centrifuging and rinsing twice with methanol.
The sample (hereafter named TRITC-NC YAG:Ce conjugate) is a light pink powder and was dried in air prior to characterization.
It should be mentioned that treatment of YAG:Ce with glycine and Rhodamine B (a dye molecule similar to TRITC, but without the isothiocyanate group) did not lead to a dye-NC YAG:Ce conjugate, showing that the presence of an isothiocyanate group is crucial for the formation of the conjugate.
Steady-state emission and excitation spectra were recorded with a SPEX Fluorolog spectrofluorometer, model F2002, equipped with two monochromators (double-grating, 0.22 m, SPEX 1680) and a 450 W xenon lamp as the excitation source.
Luminescence decay curves were measured using a Pico Quant PDL 800-B laser (λex = 440 nm, 2.5 MHz repetition rate, 55 ps pulse width) as an excitation source.
The luminescence was dispersed by a monochromator (0.1 m focal length, 1350 line mm−1 grating, blazed at 500 nm) and detected by a fast Hamamatsu H5738P-01 photomultiplier tube.
The decay curves were obtained by time correlated single photon counting (TCPCS) via time-to-amplitude conversion (TAC) with a Time Harp 100 computer card.
The ratio of stop to start pulses was kept low (below 0.05) to assure good statistics.
Fig. 3 shows the excitation spectra (A, λem = 580 nm) and emission spectra (B, λex = 440 nm) of tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC) in water (dark gray curves), NC YAG: Ce (light gray curves) and TRITC-NC YAG:Ce conjugate (black curves).
The emission spectrum of NC YAG:Ce (0.5 mol%) consists of a broad band with maximum around 550 nm that is ascribed to a 5d → 4f transition.
The 4f → 5d excitation transitions yield broad bands at around 260 nm (not shown), 340 nm and 450 nm.
The band at 260 nm is very weak because the upper 5d states of Ce3+ in YAG have energies within the conduction band of the host and therefore excitation in these levels results mainly in quenching.20
The Ce3+ 5d level populated by the transition occurring at 340 nm is just below the YAG conduction band and will also be quenched to some extent at room temperature.20
There are no significant differences between the emission and excitation spectra of NC YAG:Ce and bulk YAG:Ce, as expected considering that the band-gap of YAG is very large (7 eV) and that the electronic transitions involved in the luminescence are localized on the Ce3+ ion.
Quantum size effects, as observed for the luminescence of nanocrystalline semiconductors, are not expected for the luminescence of Ce3+ in NC YAG.
The quantum efficiency of the NC YAG:Ce sample is lower than that of a bulk sample (∼50% at λex = 430 nm, instead of the 70% observed for commercial Nichia phosphor).
The lower quantum efficiency of the nanocrystalline samples can be ascribed to a decrease in the excitation efficiency due to light scattering and to quenching and competitive absorption by surface defects (e.g. oxygen vacancies and/or disorder at grain boundaries20).
The quantum efficiencies can be improved by longer thermal treatments or higher temperatures, which however lead to undesired nanocrystal growth and sintering.
The luminescence quantum efficiency is given by the number of emitted photons divided by the number of absorbed photons, and was determined by comparison with standard phosphors, following the method of de Mello Donega et al.22
This method is accurate within 10%.
It is clear from the excitation spectra in Fig. 3A that selective excitation of NC YAG:Ce is possible at 440 nm (TRITC hardly absorbs at this wavelength).
The black curve in Fig. 3B shows the emission spectrum of TRITC–NC YAG:Ce conjugate under 440 nm excitation.
The weak band around 520 nm can be ascribed to Ce3+ emission, while the peak around 580 nm is due to TRITC emission.
This provides a clear indication that ET from Ce3+ ions to TRITC takes place, since the TRITC emission dominates the emission spectrum despite its negligible absorption at 440 nm, whereas the strong absorption of YAG:Ce at 440 nm yields only a weak Ce3+ luminescence.
We would like to point out that the spectral overlap between the emission of the donor and the absorption of the acceptor, needed for ET via dipole-dipole interaction, is good since the maximum of the donor (Ce3+) emission and the acceptor (TRITC) absorption band are both situated around 550 nm.
In the excitation spectrum of TRITC–NC YAG:Ce conjugate (Fig. 3A, black curve) the peak at ∼550 nm is due to direct excitation of the TRITC.
The peak around 450 nm is ascribed to direct excitation of Ce3+ ions.
It is noteworthy that the relative intensity of the peak around 375 nm for the TRITC–NC YAG:Ce conjugate is larger than expected by a simple convolution of the excitation bands of NC YAG:Ce and TRITC, suggesting an increased excitation efficiency due to resonance between the Ce3+ 5d level at 3.64 eV (340 nm) and TRITC excited states.
This resonance would lead to efficient ET between the two levels, competing with the depopulation of the Ce3+ 5d level via the YAG conduction band.
The observation of Ce3+ excitation bands in the excitation spectrum of the TRITC emission at 580 nm in the conjugate sample provides further evidence for the occurrence of Ce3+ → TRITC ET, but it is not unambiguous since the broad emission band of Ce3+ overlaps with the emission of TRITC.
The luminescence decay curve of the Ce3+ emission provides a more direct way to probe whether Ce3+ → TRITC ET is indeed taking place.
Fig. 4 shows the luminescence decay curves of NC YAG:Ce (in light gray) and of TRITC–NC YAG:Ce conjugate (in black).
The decay curves are recorded monitoring luminescence at 520 nm to avoid detection of the TRITC emission.
The decay curve of the Ce3+ ions in YAG is nearly monoexponential and has a decay time of 60 ns.
This is very close to the reported decay time of Ce3+ ions in bulk YAG sample (65 ns,20).
This is surprising since the effective refractive index is lower in NC YAG:Ce than in the bulk material due to the presence of a lower refractive index material (liquid helium or air) around the nanocrystals and within a distance of the order of the wavelength of light.
It is expected that, through local field effects, the lower effective refractive index would reduce the radiative decay rate of the Ce3+ emission in NC YAG:Ce in comparison with the bulk.
This effect has already been observed for NC Y2O3:Eu3+.23
In the case of NC YAG:Ce, however, the filling fraction is not known, what makes the comparison with the previous studies on NC Y2O3:Eu3+ difficult.
Further, non-radiative processes are more important for the nanocrystal than for the bulk materials due to the larger surface to volume ratio, which is reflected in an initial deviation from single-exponential decay and a lower quantum efficiency.
The slightly faster initial decay, observed for NC YAG:Ce can explain why the luminescence decay time measured, defined as the time at which the emission intensity has dropped to 1/e of its initial value, is shorter for the NC YAG:Ce despite the lower effective refractive index.
For the TRITC–NC YAG:Ce conjugate (black curve) a fast initial decay in the luminescence intensity of the Ce3+ ion is observed, indicating the presence of an additional decay channel for the Ce3+ ions in the conjugate, which can be ascribed to resonant ET from the 5d excited states of Ce3+ in YAG to acceptor excited states of TRITC molecules at the nanocrystals surface.
Radiative transfer from the Ce3+ ions to the TRITC molecules may also occur, but would not lead to shorter life times for the donor states.
The fact that coupling to TRITC results in significantly faster luminescence decay curve shows that non-radiative energy transfer via dipole–dipole interaction is dominant.
The average ET rate can be estimated from the decay curves and is ∼108–109 s−1.
Since both the Ce3+ and the TRITC emissions are allowed electric-dipole transitions, the dipole–dipole interaction will be strong allowing efficient ET to occur if the Ce3+–TRITC distances are sufficiently small.
Using the Förster–Dexter theory for energy transfer via dipole–dipole interaction an estimate of the energy transfer rate can be made.
The critical distance for energy transfer (where the radiative rate equals the energy transfer rate) is given by24R6c = 3 × 1012fAE−4SOHere fA is the oscillator strength of the acceptor transition, E is the energy at the maximum of spectral overlap (in eV) and SO is the spectral overlap integral.
The oscillator strength as determined from the TRITC absorption spectrum is about 0.5.
The spectral overlap determined from the YAG:Ce emission and TRITC absorption spectrum is 2 eV−1.
This gives a critical distance for energy transfer from Ce3+ to TRITC of about 7 nm.
As a result, energy transfer rates of 108 s−1 and faster are expected for Ce3+ ions in an outer shell of 5 nm thick in the NC.
This is quite consistent with the observations.
The luminescence decay curves show that a majority of the Ce3+ show a fast decay due to efficient energy transfer to TRITC.
For the average size of 18 nm YAG:Ce nanocrystals more than 90% of the Ce3+ ions will be within a 5 nm distance from the surface and will transfer the excitation energy with transfer rates of 108 s−1 and higher to TRITC molecules at the surface.
It should be noted that a 18 nm diameter YAG:Ce (0.5 mol%) nanocrystal contains about 1700 Ce3+ ions statistically distributed over all available Y3+ sites.
This will cause a distribution in the TRITC to Ce3+ distances.
Since ET by electric dipole-electric dipole interaction scales with r−6, Ce3+ ions closer to the surface will transfer their energy much more efficiently then ions in the core of the nanocrystal.
This distribution of donor-acceptor distances will result in a distribution of ET rates between Ce3+ ions and TRITC molecules.
The size polydispersity inherent to the NC YAG:Ce samples further broadens the distribution of ET rates.
Therefore only an average ET rate can be determined from the experimental data.
ET is not only possible between the Ce3+ ions and the TRITC molecules but also between Ce3+ ions.
Therefore Ce3+ ions deep inside the nanocrystals may also transfer their energy to Ce3+ ions closer to the surface which subsequently transfer their excitation energy to the TRITC molecules, thus increasing the ET rate.
A more quantitative analysis of the energy transfer process is not possible in view of the various uncertainties discussed above.
Photobleaching can be used as a control experiment25 to show that the decay time shortening of the Ce3+ luminescence observed in the TRITC-YAG:Ce conjugate is indeed due to energy transfer.
TRITC will degrade after being exposed to UV light for a long period, while YAG:Ce is photostable.
Fig. 5 shows the excitation (A) and emission (B) spectra of the TRITC-YAG:Ce conjugate prior to (dark gray) and after (black) 65 hours of irradiation with 300 nm light from a 450 W xenon lamp.
The color of the sample after irradiation changed from pink to slight yellow, clearly indicating that the photodecomposition of the TRITC molecules has occurred.
In the excitation spectrum of the photobleached sample (Fig. 5A) the peak around 550 nm (due to direct excitation of TRITC) is strongly reduced, which implies that the amount of TRITC in the sample has decreased.
However, not all the TRITC molecules were bleached, despite the long period of UV radiation, possibly because the strong scattering characteristic of nanoporous materials limits the penetration depth of the light.
In the emission spectra (Fig. 5B) a strong decrease in the emission intensity of the peak around 580 nm (the TRITC emission) is observed after bleaching.
Since less TRITC is present at the surface, the average distance between Ce3+ ions and TRITC molecules increases.
Therefore the likelihood of Ce3+ to TRITC energy transfer is diminished and the fraction of radiative recombination of the Ce3+ ions increases.
Both contributions will be reflected in the decay curves of the photobleached TRITC–YAG:Ce conjugate sample (Fig. 4, dark gray curve).
The fast initial decay is still present, but has a much smaller contribution than prior to the photobleaching, indicating that a smaller population of Ce3+ ions have a TRITC molecule at distances short enough to allow efficient ET to take place.
This is also reflected in the larger contribution of the exponential decay tail due to the radiative decay of the Ce3+ ions without neighboring TRITC molecules.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that efficient energy transfer (ET rates of ∼108–109 s−1) from Ce3+ ions to TRITC molecules occurs in the TRITC-NC YAG:Ce conjugate.
Also, we have shown that nanocrystalline YAG:Ce can be successfully conjugated to organic molecules, therefore establishing its potentiality as a biolabel.
Additional experiments aiming at imaging and spectrally resolving single YAG:Ce nanocrystals have also been successfully carried out and will be reported elsewhere.
Reaction pathways for growth of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons under combustion conditions, a DFT study
Models of soot formation include the growth of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as an essential step.
We investigate two reaction pathways for growth of PAHs, both initiated by radical formation.
The first type, the so called HACA mechanism, is based on stepwise acetylene addition and we identify promising reactions not considered before.
Examples are the synthesis of perylene and phenanthro[1,10,9,8–opqra]perylene.
The second type of reaction concerns direct condensation of phenyl, naphthyl or anthracenyl with another PAH.
Pathways for these reactions require merely up to 100 kJ mol−1 for the activation barrier, which makes them viable candidates for PAH growth.
Soot is a typical byproduct of hydrocarbon combustion; this is undesirable since it indicates incomplete combustion and also entails a considerable health hazard.1
Soot is at the same time a viable material if prepared with well defined properties, that can be achieved in pyrolysis from, e.g. methane, acetylene or other hydrocarbons.
So produced, it has many applications in chemical industry and material science.2–5
Detailed understanding of mechanisms of soot formation in combustions, pyrolysis, and also techniques such as carbon vapor deposition (CVD) are essential for controlling these processes.
It has been the main aim of the present work to better characterize the elementary reactions in the gas phase, which play a role in soot formation.
The central issue is here the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are the main constituents of soot; the PAHs are also health hazards since they are carcinogenic.1
The formation of the first aromatic ring under pyrolysis conditions has been studied by various groups.
It appears that there are different types of growth reactions pathways depending on the fuel and actual conditions.6–9
Starting from methane or acetylene as precursors Frenklach et al. propose a reaction for the formation of the first aromatic ring from n-C4H3 and acetylene.10,11
Bittner and Howard suggest in addition the reaction of n-C4H5 with acetylene occurring especially at low temperatures.
Miller and Melius pointed to a problem in these C4-routes: n-C4H3 and n-C4H5 should convert to the corresponding resonance stabilized isomers (iso-C4H3 and iso-C4H5).12
Therefore, they recommend together with others6,13,14 a C3-route over propargyl radicals.
For further growth (beyond benzene), the most popular mechanism is the hydrogen-abstraction/acetylene-addition, which is explicitly suggested by Bockhorn et al.15
Independently Frenklach and coworkers refined a similar sequence of reactions10 and termed it the ‘HACA’-mechanism (Hydrogen-Abstraction-C2H2-Addition).16
Böhm et al. have proposed a combination of a ring–ring condensation and acetylene addition,17 since reactions with acetylene alone apparently cannot describe the timescale of soot formation.
A related model is proposed by Dong and Hüttinger, the so called particle-filler model:18 aromatic hydrocarbons constitute the molecular particles and acetylene the molecular filler.
In this model the initial step leads to a biaryl bond, then followed by a dehydrocyclization reaction forming a five- or six-membered ring.
Bays of PAHs involving three or four carbon atoms can be closed by addition of acetylene leading to five- and six-membered rings.
With their model18 they are able to predict the texture of pyrolytic carbon: at low temperatures, low pressures, short residence times and high surface area/volume ratios, formation of sufficient amount of PAHs is limited thus leading to low-ordered carbon.
On the other hand one gets a highly ordered carbon under high temperatures, high pressures, long residence times and low surface area/volume ratios.
However, the temperatures should not be too high to avoid too fast growth.18
The present computational study is carried out to obtain energetic data for some reactions of interest in soot formation, as indicated above.
We have shown previously that semiempirical PM3 calculations give occasionally considerable errors, e.g. 100 kJ mol−1 for the addition of a hydrogen atom to pyrene.19
In this work we describe different reaction pathways leading to PAHs; first we determine barriers and reaction energies for the HACA mechanism for naphthalene, acenaphthylene and phenanthrene as examples.
As far as PM3 data are available,20 we compare these with our calculations.
We follow here the HACA-mechanism and do not consider reactions like PAH + C2H; since the latter require additional hydrogen migration and can only proceed by a perturbation of the aromatic system.
Second we study aromatic condensation of PAHs; this should have a bearing on the model of Dong and Hüttinger.18
We assume that, as in the HACA process, condensation is initiated by radical formation, and then consider reactions of phenyl, naphthyl and anthracenyl with another PAH to yield for example fluoranthene or perylene.
Reaction pathways of the polyaromatic growth have clearly been considered before, but these investigations have either been carried out at the PM3 level,20 or are limited to systems with ten carbon atoms at most;21–23 aromatic condensations have not been modeled before to our knowledge.
Geometry optimizations have been carried out to locate minima and transition states with gradient corrected DFT methods as implemented in the TURBOMOLE program package.24–26
We use mainly the functional B3LYP,27,28 since this is the standard tool for these purposes.
In addition, all investigations have been done using the BP86 functional29–32 in combination with the very efficient RI-J approximation,33,34 which reduces the CPU times to about 10% of corresponding B3LYP calculations.
This was done to ascertain the reliability of BP86, which offers the prospect to treat much larger systems.
The standard TURBOMOLE basis set SV(P) (split valence augmented by a polarization d set on C) is employed35,36 and test calculations are performed with larger basis sets like TZVPP,37 and restricted open shell (ROHF-) RIMP2,38,39 and also ROHF-RICC.240
Redundant internal coordinates are used in the structure optimization of minima.41
Optimization of saddle points is performed with the TRIM (trust radius image minimization)42 method now implemented in TURBOMOLE.
Harmonic frequency calculations are carried out for all species;43,44 all minima presented show only real frequencies and the first-order saddle points have only a single imaginary frequency.
Reaction enthalpies are computed within the harmonic approximation using frequencies obtained from analytical second derivatives at B3LYP/SV(P) and BP86/SV(P) level, respectively.
Let us first point out that accuracy requirements are relatively moderate for present purposes, since we are dealing with high-temperature reactions; pyrolysis is typically carried out at 1100 K–1300 K. To estimate the error in the barrier energies we consider the hydrogen abstraction with a hydrogen atom from the gas phase, since this is a crucial step for many of the reactions considered below.
As first example we chose a radical reaction with small molecules for which experimental data are available CH4 + H → CH3HH → CH3 + H2.The barrier of the transition state calculated on DFT/B3LYP/SV(P) is +38 kJ mol−1 (+25 kJ mol−1 for DFT/BP86/SV(P)) and the experimental result is +50 kJ mol−1.45
The next system considered is the reaction C6H6 + H → C6H5 + H2.
In Table 1 we compare various methods and basis sets.
ΔE1 denotes the difference between educts and transition state (barriers) and ΔE2 the difference between educts and products (reaction energies).
Here, one can see that the computed ΔE decrease with increasing basis, and the smallest basis set gives values near experimental ΔE2, particularly for DFT/B3LYP/SV(P); this has also been pointed out by Houk et al.46
The large deviation of the ROHF-RIMP2 and ROHF-RICC2 methods is caused by the (partial) multireference character of phenyl;47 the calculated values are simply not reliable.
We have further considered the next larger system, naphthalene + hydrogen, the results are very similar to those listed in Table 1.
B3LYP typically underestimates barriers by 10–35%,48,49 which is a well known and presently unavoidable deficiency, at least for systems of this size.
We follow previous investigations20,50 and report ΔHR values under standard conditions within the harmonic approximation, we will comment on this in the summary.
Frenklach and Wang have proposed that the growth of soot particles on surfaces takes place via the so called HACA mechanism.16
This consists of the following steps: hydrogen abstraction creating a surface radical, acetylene addition to the radical formed, and ring cyclization as shown in Fig. 1.
The first reaction considered in this work, subsection 1, is the generation of acenaphthylene [6] from naphthyl radical [1] and acetylene, a five-ring cyclization at the smallest system representing a zigzag border.47
The second reaction, subsection 2, is a transformation of the five-membered ring to a six-membered ring by adding acetylene to an acenaphthyl radical [6a] resulting in a phenanthryl radical [17].
This reaction was proposed by Frenklach et al20. and we will compare their PM3 results with DFT (BP86 and B3LYP).
The next reaction, subsection 3, will also be compared with PM3: building a six-membered ring on phenanthryl [17] to form pyrene [23].
In subsection 4 we compare the HACA mechanism of Frenklach and the Bittner–Howard mechanism,51 where two acetylene are added in sequence to acenaphthyl [6a] leading to aceanthrylene [31].
Fig. 2. shows the reaction enthalpies at 298 K for the acetylene addition to naphthyl radical [1] to yield acenaphthylene [6] and hydrogen.
In Table 2 we compare calculated B3LYP and BP86 results for elementary steps of this reaction.
The reaction is exothermic by 163 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (181 kJ mol−1 for BP86), the highest barrier of the total reaction path (relative to the educts) is 19 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (8 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
The reaction begins with the formation of [2] which proceeds to either [3] via hydrogen migration or to [4] under hydrogen atom loss.
At B3LYP level the way to [3] shows a barrier of 26 kJ mol−1 (4 kJ mol−1 BP86), significantly lower than the one to [4] of 150 kJ mol−1 (147 kJ mol−1 BP86).
However, the reaction channel to [4] is exothermic and the barrier is moderate considering typical reaction conditions of pyrolysis.52
The barrier of the ring cyclization of [3] to [5] is 42 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (28 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
Forming [6] under hydrogen loss has an activation barrier of 192 kJ mol−1, the transition state is just 2 kJ mol−1 above the energy of the final product (BP86 shows no additional barrier).
The second reaction, Fig. 3 and Table 3, is the transformation from a five- to a six-membered ring.
The reaction is exothermic by 312 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (320 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
The HACA mechanism proceeds through formation of [11] and [16], respectively and the highest barrier of the reaction path is found to be 227 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (227 kJ mol−1 for BP86) for the formation of [11].
The treatment of the first steps of the reaction path up to [10] is straightforward.
But then we run into a problem: Educt [6a] and product [17] are radicals with clear cut doublet character (one singly occupied molecular orbital); a visualization of spin densities further shows the unpaired spin to be localized on a single center.
The intermediates [11] and [16] give rise to three radical centers, which have to be coupled to a doublet.
This is not possible in a clear cut way with standard DFT.
Since the three singly occupied molecular orbitals in [11] are located on different centers, as indicated in Fig. 3, one has small exchange integrals and energies obtained with different spin distributions (ααα vs. ααβ etc.) are virtually identical.
The differences amount to merely 4 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (and also for BP86).
(On the DFT level [16] is actually a minimum for the quartet state, the energy in Table 3 is given in parentheses).
Our investigation leads to a new pathway starting from [10] over TS12, [14] and TS14 to yield [15], solid black line in Fig. 3.
This proceeds over clear cut doublets only (〈S2〉 = 0.78 for TS12) and avoids the problems just discussed.
The barrier from [10] to TS12 is 182 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (153 kJ mol−1 BP86).
This should be the favored reaction pathway.
A comparison with Frenklach’s PM3 results20 shows reasonable agreement with present results up to [10], but we do not find indications that intermediates with three radical centers play a role for this reaction.
The six-membered ring cyclization is depicted in Fig. 4 and the energetic results are presented in Table 4.
Here also PM3 results are available.20
We find an exothermic reaction of 257 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (268 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
The highest barrier of the total path is calculated to be 29 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (15 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
Starting after the formation of [18] the radical has three possibilities to react.
The first way is described in the two reactions discussed above: under hydrogen loss we get [21], which presents the same behavior as described in subsection 3.1.2 (C12H7 [6a] + C2H2 → C14H9 [17]).
PM3 results show an endothermic reaction and DFT an exothermic pathway.
The second way leads to [19] via ring cyclization and the last way is a H-migration from the C2H2 group to the six-membered ring [20] followed by ring cyclization [22].
Both radicals, [19] and [22], decompose to pyrene [23].
Discrepancies between PM3 and B3LYP (or BP86) are considerable, Table 4: the barrier height of TS20 from PM3 is 100 kJ mol−1, while it is 16 kJ mol−1 for DFT/B3LYP (14 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
Furthermore the reaction enthalpies for the formation of pyrene differ by about 107 kJ mol−1 between B3LYP and PM3 (118 kJ mol−1 between BP86 and PM3).
This has also been pointed out in a previous paper19.
For this reaction we compare Frenklach’s HACA mechanism (solid line in Fig. 5), and the mechanism of Bittner and Howard,51 (dashed line in Fig. 5).
Bauschlicher and coworkers have studied both mechanisms for a similar reaction: benzene + 2 C2H2 → naphthalene.53
They found that both mechanisms have low barriers.
The reaction is exothermic with 449 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (477 kJ mol−1 for BP86, see Table 5).
The first step is the exothermic formation of [24] from [6a] and acetylene, which shows only a small barrier of 18 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (7 kJ mol−1 for BP86) and this is the highest barrier of the total reaction pathway.
From this point the two pathways differ because in the HACA mechanism the second acetylene is added later than in the Bittner–Howard mechanism.
We first consider the Frenklach mechanism (solid line in Fig. 5).
The hydrogen migration from the six-membered ring to the C2H2 group [26] has a barrier of 104 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (84 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
Again an acetylene addition leads to [28] with a barrier of 25 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (11 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
A ring cyclization [30] takes place without any barrier.
The reaction ends forming aceanthrylene [31] by decomposition of [30].
The Bittner–Howard mechanism on [24] is a direct addition of acetylene at the C2H2 group of [25] with a barrier of 20 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (13 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
This barrier is significantly lower than the step from [24] to [26].
The 1,6-H-shift [27] has no barrier for BP86 calculations and a small one with the B3LYP functional.
Another small activation barrier from [27] to [29] is found for the ring cyclization.
Decomposition of [29] leads to aceanthrylene [31].
As a summary, we find that the Bittner–Howard mechanism is slightly favored, since the barrier for [24] to [25] is only 23 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (13 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
This result is in line with that of Bauschlicher et al53. for the analogous reaction of benzene and two acetylene to form naphthalene.
The formation of [9] under hydrogen loss is not further investigated because the other pathways are significantly lower.
In the second part we consider the condensation of aromatic compounds.
Two PAHs are connected to form a larger PAH under the formation of hydrogen molecule(s).
We start again with number [1] counting the molecules.
In the first reaction, subsection 1, benzene [1] reacts with naphthyl radical [2a] forming fluoranthene [8].
The next reaction (subsection 2), is the condensation of naphthalene [2] with naphthyl radical [2a] to perylene [13].
In the last process, subsection 3, anthracene [14] reacts with an anthracenyl radical [14a] to form phenanthro[1,10,9,8–opqra]perylene (phenanthroperylene) [22].
Fig. 6 and Table 6 show the aromatic condensation of benzene [1] with a naphthyl radical [2a].
The reaction is endothermic by 24 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (14 kJ mol−1 for BP86) and the highest barrier of the reaction path, relative to the educts, is obtained to be 85 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (60 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
The analogous reaction of phenyl [1a] and naphthalene [2] is also calculated (dashed line).
[3] is lower in energy than [4] by 39 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (37 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
This is due to the stabilization of the radical through the π-system.
The next step is the separation of a hydrogen atom leading to [5].
The energy of the barrier from [3] to [5] is found to be 132 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (126 kJ mol−1 for BP86) and from [4] to [5] it is 104 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (96 kJ mol−1 BP86).
The following step is an assisted hydrogen abstraction under formation of H2 and [6] with a barrier of 51 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (36 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
The barrier of the ring cyclization forming a fluoranthenyl radical [7] has been computed to be 52 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (37 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
The final step is the decomposition to fluoranthene [8], through a barrier of 113 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (108 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
The second example for the aromatic condensation is the reaction of naphthalene [2] with a naphthyl radical [2a] to perylene [13], see Fig. 7.
This reaction is slightly exothermic by 5 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (19 kJ mol−1 for BP86) and the highest barrier of the total reaction pathway is calculated to be 65 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (45 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
The first barrier, to get [9], is 27 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (16 kJ mol−1 for BP86) (Table 7).
The radical is again stabilized through the π-system, as mentioned above for [3].
Hydrogen loss leads to [10] over a barrier of 131 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (126 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
The following step is a hydrogen abstraction by forming a hydrogen molecule and [11].
The barrier is 68 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (50 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
The ring cyclization [12] has a small barrier of 25 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (13 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
Separation of a hydrogen atom gives perylene [13].
The barrier is 104 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (108 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
The reaction of anthracene [14] with an anthracenyl radical [14a] is the third aromatic condensation, see Fig. 8 and Table 8.
The reaction is exothermic by 24 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (47 kJ mol−1 for BP86) and the highest barrier of the total reaction pathway, relative to the educts, is calculated to be 97 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (62 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
Starting with the addition of the two molecules one gets [15].
The computed barrier is 21 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (14 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
Hydrogen separation leading to [16] has a barrier of 147 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (139 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
The following H abstraction under formation of H2 and [17] has a barrier height of 59 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (42 kJ mol−1 for BP86) similar to the two aromatic condensations discussed in subsection 1 and 2.
A first ring cyclization follows, introducing a steric strain in the molecule [18].
The barrier is 17 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (6 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
The next step is the second loss of hydrogen to [19].
Then follows another hydrogen abstraction with a similar barrier as for the first one: 51 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (26 kJ mol−1 for BP86) for [20] and H2.
The second ring cyclization leading to [21] occurs next.
At BP86 level no barrier is obtained; B3LYP leads to an insignificant barrier of 1 kJ mol−1.
Consequently, the ring closure takes place directly.
The last step is a hydrogen loss with a barrier of 106 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP (102 kJ mol−1 for BP86).
We would like to mention briefly common features and differences of the aromatic condensation reactions.
The crucial step for the smaller cases, see Fig. 6 and Table 6, is clearly the ring closure, e.g. from [6] to [7].
The corresponding barrier is reduced in going to larger reactants, e.g. from +85 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP, Fig. 6, to +69 kJ mol−1 for B3LYP in Fig. 8.
On the other hand, the hydrogen abstraction in the intermediates, e.g. from [19] to [20] in Fig. 8, is connected with increasing barrier if systems become larger; as example we mention the barrier of +51 kJ mol−1 (B3LYP) relative to the educts from 5 to 6 as compared to +97 kJ mol−1 (B3LYP) from [19] to [20].
We attribute this increase to the fact that the reaction center is more crowded in the larger systems, which hinders the reaction.
We expect that both trends continue, even if reactions of large PAH are considered.
We have considered a variety of reactions to rationalize soot formation, e.g. under conditions typical for pyrolysis.
Our treatment is based on the assumption that radical formation, e.g. by hydrogen abstraction, is the initial step, on which the HACA mechanism is based too.
We did not consider the reaction PAH + C2H, since these require additional hydrogen migration and can only proceed by a perturbation of the aromatic system.
We proposed some new reaction pathways, Fig. 5, and steps for the HACA mechanism, Fig. 3 from [10] over [14] to [15] or from [11] over [12] and [13] to [15].
Our investigations confirm that the reactions, once a radical is available, proceed with relatively low barriers to make this good candidates for growth of PAHs and soot particles.
As a byproduct we confirm a previous result that PM3 is occasionally insufficient for a semi-quantitative description.
We have further considered condensation of two PAHs, one of them again assumed to be a radical.
For three typical reactions, Figs. 6–8, we have obtained reaction pathways, which proceed with barriers of typically less than 100 kJ mol−1.
This implies that these condensations could play an important role in soot formation.
The influence of entropies can easily be computed within the harmonic approximation; since we are dealing with radical reactions there could be a non-negligible contribution from the electronic term in the entropy.
We point out that the temperature dependency is in the ΔH term and the entropy is in the pre-factor of the Arrhenius equation, which in the modeling of kinetics is typically used as an adjustable parameter.
Lets come back to the temperature dependence mentioned in section 1, a temperature raise from 298 K to 1100 K has only a minor influence on ΔHr: about 6 kJ mol−1 for the first reaction of the acetylene addition and about 20 kJ mol−1 for the first aromatic condensation (benzene + naphthyl radical) (within the harmonic approximation).
We regard this again as not essential.
The calculations have been carried out at B3LYP level, which appears the standard choice for this type of investigations.
These results have been compared with those employing the BP86 functional, which always yields lower barriers but virtually identical reaction energies.
The deviations up to 35 kJ mol−1 in barriers and 28 kJ mol−1 in reaction energies appear not to be a serious problem under typical pyrolysis conditions (1300 K).
Since the non-hybrid functional requires typically 10% of CPU times necessary for B3LYP, this paves the way to treat systems with up to 100 atoms.
A theoretical treatment of the Ã 2Σ+state of the Ar⋯HS/Ar⋯SH van der Waals complex
We present an ab initio potential energy surface for the Ã 2Σ+ state of the Ar⋯HS van der Waals molecule.
The surface represents a fit to 196 points calculated at the RCCSD(T) level with an aug-cc-pV5Z basis set and encompasses both the Ar⋯SH and Ar⋯HS isomers.
We have further calculated vibrational levels on this surface using a discrete variable representation (DVR) approach.
The vibrational levels supported within the Ar⋯HS minimum are compared with levels derived from high-resolution laser induced fluorescence spectra.
Predictions of vibrational levels for the Ar⋯SH isomer, which have not been observed experimentally, are also presented.
There is currently much interest in the spectroscopy and structure of van der Waals complexes of rare gas atoms with free radical species OH and SH.
Carter et al1. have recently reviewed studies of the complexes with Ne, Ar and Kr concentrating on the analysis of the rotational and vibrational structure of the electronic transition between the X̃ 2Π3/2 and Ã 2Σ+ states.
For each of these species, high quality empirical potential energy surfaces have been derived from high resolution laser induced fluorescence (LIF) spectra obtained in the Miller group.
Ab initio potential energy surfaces have been calculated for the OH and SH complexes with He and Ne.2,3
In these studies, basis sets of aug-cc-pVTZ or aug-cc-pVQZ quality4–6 were augmented with sets of bond functions7,8 at the mid-point of the vector connecting the rare gas atom with the centre-of-mass of the diatomic radical.
The ab initio calculations were made with the RCCSD(T) method.9,10
For both the empirical and ab initio surfaces the rotation–vibration energy levels were calculated by a discrete variable representation (DVR) method derived from that originally proposed by Choi and Light.11
A number of spectroscopic studies of the Ar⋯HS complex have been reported by Miller and coworkers: The laser induced fluorescence spectrum for the Ã 2Σ+–X̃ 2Π transition was first reported in .199312
Subsequent papers reported improved data for the vibrational spectrum of Ne⋯HS, Ar⋯HS and Kr⋯HS13 and a high resolution rotationally resolved spectrum of Ar⋯HS.14
In a further paper, Korambath et al15. used these spectroscopic data to derive empirical potential energy surfaces for the Ã 2Σ+ states of Ar⋯HS and Kr⋯HS.
The parameters of a functional form suggested by Bowman and co-workers16,17 were varied to reproduce the observed transition wavenumbers and rotational constants and a DVR method was used to calculate the energy levels and rotational constants.
For Ar⋯HS, 11 parameters were varied to fit 7 vibrational energy levels and 8 rotational constants.
As shown by Miller et al., the experiment samples only the portion of the potential energy surface for Ar⋯HS angles between 0 and 90° (i.e., from the Ar⋯H–S linear geometry to the T-shaped structure).
Hence the optimization of the potential function did not vary parameters relevant to 180° (i.e., Ar⋯SH isomer).
Agreement was within ±0.3 cm−1 for the energy levels.
The empirical potential energy function of Korambath et al15. has been used subsequently by McCoy18 in calculations of the lifetime of Ar⋯HS Ã 2Σ+ state levels and by Firsov et al19. in calculations of the vibrational energy levels of Ar⋯HS by a vibration self-consistent field method.
In most experimental studies, Ar⋯HS complexes have been produced by photolysis of a mixture of H2S co-expanded with Ar.12–14
A novel alternative method for the generation of the open-shell complexes has been described by Mackenzie et al.,20,21 in which small ArnH2S clusters (n ≤ 2) are first formed in a pulsed supersonic expansion and then photolyzed downstream from the expansion.
It was shown that bound Arn⋯SH species can be produced efficiently by this method.
Further, analysis of LIF spectra of the complexes generated indicated extensive van der Waals stretch/bend and overall rotational excitation.
Quasi-classical trajectory calculations to simulate the cluster photofragmentation dynamics have been made by Fair and Nesbitt.22
In the absence of ab initio potentials, this necessitated the construction of qualitative potential energy surfaces from Ar⋯H2O, Ar⋯OH, H2S and Ar2 surfaces.
Sumiyoshi et al23. have obtained rotational spectra by Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy (FTMW) for the X̃ 2Π ground state of Ar⋯SH.
They derived a two-dimensional potential energy surface by a least-squares procedure in which they fitted the observed rotational transitions.
Since the experimental data were insufficient to determine all of the potential parameters, some parameters were derived from an ab initio potential surface calculated by the RCCSD(T) method with an aug-cc-pVQZ basis set.
The same authors have since revised their surface to satisfactorily reproduce all of the experimentally obtained rotational frequencies for both Ar⋯SH and Ar⋯SD.24
Their ab initio surfaces were obtained from RCCSD(T) calculations with an aug-cc-pVTZ basis set augmented with bond functions.
An effective correction term was introduced to account for a small difference between the potentials for the SH and SD complexes.
In this article we report an ab initio potential energy surface for the Ã 2Σ+ state of Ar⋯SH.
Our calculations consider the full range of geometries from the linear Ar⋯HS configuration to linear Ar⋯SH.
The ab initio energies have been fitted to a functional form which we have used in a DVR calculation for the vibrational energy levels.
Rotational constants calculated for levels on our surface agree extremely well with the experimental data of Korambath et al.
In common with other ab initio calculations the energy levels spacings calculated on our surface are systematically lower than those observed.
By extending the surface to encompass all angles, we are able to predict wavenumbers for Ã-state levels in the Ar⋯SH isomer transitions to which, to the best of our knowledge, have not been identified thus far.
The ab initio surface calculations were made with the MOLPRO suite of programs.25
The aug-cc-pV5Z basis set4–6 was used and the molecular orbitals for the 2 2A′ state calculated by the RHF method.
In all cases care was taken to ensure that the electronic configuration of the HS fragment corresponded to ⋯4σ22π45σ1 and at no point were any convergence problems encountered.
Electron correlation was accounted for with the RCCSD(T) method9,10 and the counterpoise method of Boys and Bernardi was used to correct for basis set superposition errors.26
The geometry of the complex is defined in terms of Jacobi coordinates (R, γ) where R defines the distance of Ar from the center-of-mass of the HS radical and γ defines the angle between the vector R and the HS molecular axis.
The angle γ is defined such that γ = 0° corresponds to the Ar⋯HS configuration.
The angle γ was varied from 0 to 180° in steps of 15°.
For most angles R ranged from 2.75 to 10 Å but for γ = 180° the range was extended to 2.4 Å to give a more complete description of the linear Ar⋯SH configuration.
Ab initio energies were calculated for a total of 196 points.
In all calculations the SH distance was kept fixed at 1.423 Å, the re value for the Ã 2Σ+ state of SH.27
To fit the ab initio energies we have used an extended form of the model potential proposed by Bukowski et al28. which has been used successfully to fit a number of ab initio potential surfaces for rare gas complexes.8
The potential function is written as the sum of short range (Vsr) and asymptotic (Vas) termsV(R, γ) = Vsr(R, γ) + Vas(R, γ).The short-range interaction is given byVsr(R, γ) = G(R, γ)exp[D(γ) − B(γ)R],where D(γ), B(γ) and G(R, γ) are expansions in terms of Legendre polynomials, Pl(cos γ).
The functions B(γ), D(γ) are given by the expressions
andin which bl, dl and gnl are adjustable parameters.
The asymptotic term in eqn. (1) is given bywhere Cnl are adjustable parameters and the function fn(x) is the Tang–Toennies damping function,29In previous formulations,28 in which there were 40 adjustable parameters, the summations over l were restricted to l = 0–5 and the polynomial in R in the expression for G(R, γ) included terms up to and including R3.
We were not able to obtain a satisfactory fit with 40 adjustable parameters.
With this more flexible function involving 60 parameters, we were able to fit 196 ab initio points such that for the vast majority of points the deviation from the calculated energy was less than 1 cm−1.
Table 1 contains details of the parameters obtained in our fit.
Vibrational energy levels on the final surface were calculated by a DVR method in which the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonianwere obtained.
In eqn. (7), Ĵ is the total angular momentum operator of the complex and ĵ is the angular momentum operator for the HS diatomic molecule.
The projections of J and j along the body-fixed z-axis (along R, the vector connecting the Ar atom to the center of mass of HS) are the same and both are represented by projection quantum number K. bv is the vibrationally averaged rotational constant for the HS radical, and the reduced mass of the atom–diatom complex is represented by μR.
The calculations were performed using the DVR code of McCoy30 in which the Hamiltonian is set up and diagonalized in three stages for a given value of J and the total parity of the system.
Only the v = 0 state of the HS moiety, with b0/hc = 8.289 cm−1, was considered.
For each value of R and a given value of K, the eigenvalues of the one-dimensional bend Hamiltonian are determined.
In this stage 30 zero-order bend states are used and the 10 most important are retained following diagonalization.
The R dependence is introduced by taking 120 DVR points along the vector R using the form of Colbert and Miller31 for the DVR.
After this diagonalization the 20 most important stretch/bend eigenstates are retained for each value of K.
A contour diagram of our potential energy surface is shown in Fig. 1.
The global minimum corresponds to the linear Ar⋯HS isomer (γ = 0°) but there is a second minimum almost as deep for linear Ar⋯SH.
The two minima are separated by a >600 cm−1 barrier which prevents internal rotation for the lowest vibrational levels.
Cuts through the potential energy surface for γ = 0° and γ = 180° are shown in Fig. 2 and details of the geometries of the minima and the saddle point are given in Table 2.
In Table 3 we report the energy levels and rotational constants obtained from the DVR calculations.
The vibrational levels are labeled by convention as (vSH, nK, vvdw) where vSH is the number of vibrational quanta in the SH moiety, nK is the quantum number describing the bending motion (with projection K on the internuclear axis) and vvdw is the number of quanta in the van der Waals vibrational mode.
In Fig. 3(a) we show the square of the vibrational wavefunction, |ψ2|, for the (0, 00, 0) zero point levels of the Ar⋯HS and Ar⋯SH isomers superposed on the potential energy surface.
However, due to the polar nature of the (R, γ) coordinate system used here, |ψ2| does not accurately represent the probability density function.
As discussed by Carter et al.,1 for this we need to plot |ψ2|sin(γ) as shown in Fig. 3(b).
Fig. 4 shows the probability density functions calculated for the (0, 00, 1) and (0, 00, 2) van der Waals stretch levels of each isomer superposed on the potential energy surface.
The wavefunctions for the pure stretching levels of each isomer are confined to their respective potential minima but sample a considerable range of R values: e.g., the two (0, 00, 2) wavefunctions each sample a range of R > 1 Å.
In Fig. 5 we show the calculated probability density functions for the (0, 11, 0) and (0, 11, 1) levels.
Interestingly, the potential does not support bending levels for the Ar⋯SH isomer.
These would lie energetically above the saddle-point in which regime Ar⋯SH and Ar⋯HS geometries would be considered as merely different conformations of the same species.
At this point it is illustrative to compare the ab initio surface with the empirical surface of Korambath et al15. derived from the high resolution laser induced fluorescence spectra.
We discuss this comparison for each of the two minima on the surface.
All lines in the Ar⋯HS Ã ← X̃ LIF spectrum were assigned to levels supported in the Ar⋯HS isomer minimum (−92° < γ < 92°) and the empirical surface15 was therefore fitted in this region of (R, γ) space only.
Our ab initio surface has a minimum of −742.5 cm−1 in this region which is considerably less deep than the −877.2 cm−1 on the empirical surface of Korambath et al.15
Interestingly, however, our value for the experimental dissociation energy, D0 (446.7 cm−1) is significantly closer to the measured value (458 cm−1) than that obtained from the empirical surface (572 cm−1).
Table 3 shows very good agreement between the rotational constants, Bv, calculated for levels on the ab initio surface and those calculated on the empirical surface.
The agreement is less satisfactory, however, for the vibrational level spacings also reported in Table 3.
The spacings calculated on the ab initio surface are consistently ∼5% smaller than the experimentally derived separations.
Unsurprisingly, the levels calculated on the empirical surface reproduce the measured levels typically to within 0.3 cm−1.
Our level of agreement is comparable with that obtained in other ab initio calculations for similar van der Waals molecules: In the ab initio study of NeSH by Cybulski et al.,3 the calculated energy level separations deviated from experiment by about 4%; Chakrovarty et al32. computed the vibrational energy levels for the Ã 2Σ+ state of Ar–OH using the CEPA surface of Esposti and Werner33 and determined vibrational spacings which were too small by about 15%.
In the absence of experimental data for this region, Korambath et al. did not attempt to fit their empirical potential surface beyond the saddle point (i.e., for γ > 90°).
For completeness, however, they approximated the surface in this region to that of the Ar⋯OH potential which itself was only known in this geometry from ab initio studies.
It is no surprise then that our ab initio surface differs significantly from the empirical surface in this region.
Our surface shows a minimum only 10% less deep than the global minimum (see Table 2).
The Ar⋯SH minimum is substantially less localized in γ than the corresponding minimum on the empirical surface.
As Firsov et al. note,19 on the empirical surface, the energy reaches half-way to the dissociation limit at an Ar⋯S–H angle only 5° from the Ar⋯SH linear geometry.
By contrast, on the ab initio surface the molecule must bend 20° from linear before this is the case.
There is still a large barrier to internal rotation (greater than 600 cm−1 from either linear extreme) but our results suggest that the molecule samples a larger range of γ space than previously thought.
We calculate that the Ar⋯SH minimum supports several vibrational levels, the spacings between which, for van der Waals stretch levels, are comparable with those between levels supported in the global minimum (see Table 3).
In the light of the above it is reasonable to ask why, if well-defined bound levels exist for the Ar⋯SH isomer (i.e., γ ∼180°), transitions to these levels have not been identified in the LIF spectrum.
The reasons are probably two-fold.
Firstly when Korambath et al. started to fit the experimental data, it may have been thought that the Ar⋯HS X̃ 2Π ground state wavefunction was localized in a single minimum around the Ar⋯HS global minimum as it is in the isovalent Ar⋯HO (where the barrier to internal rotation is 44 cm−1, significantly above the van der Waals zero point energy.34)
In such a case the Franck–Condon factors for transitions from the X̃ state would indeed be dominated by transitions to the Ar⋯HS Ã state geometry.
The other minimum would be spectroscopically invisible and it would be sensible to look to fit the spectrum to transitions to levels in the Ar⋯HS minimum.
Secondly, the Ã state of the mercapto radical undergoes rapid electronic predissociation as a result of interaction with a nearby a4 Σ− state.1
The effect is to reduce the lifetime of even the v = 0 level to ∼1 ns.
The van der Waals complexes of SH with rare-gas atoms live significantly longer due to the dramatic stabilizing effect of the complexation which lowers the Ã state potential to such an extent that the Ar⋯HS Ã state fluoresces with a lifetime of up to 600 ns.12,20,21
Experimentally, this lifetime enhancement has the major advantage that the fluorescence detection window can be delayed with respect the laser pulse thereby discriminating against the large background fluorescence signals of the SH radical which is present in large concentrations in all experiments of this type.
However, as discussed by Carter et al. in their review,1 this “caging of predissociation” can only be observed in the Ar⋯HS isomer since only in this geometry is the repulsive interaction between the H atom and the a4 Σ− state significant.
Ar⋯SH isomer levels will, in all probability, fluoresce at a sub-ns rate comparable with the SH monomer.
Thus any experiment introducing a delay before the fluorescence is measured – including the experiments by both Yang et al12. and Mackenzie et al20,21. – is insensitive to fluorescence from the Ar⋯SH levels.
The FT microwave spectroscopy of the Ar⋯SH ground state by Sumiyoshi et al23,24. has shown that, far from being a hindered rotor, the zero point level lies some 20 cm−1 above the barrier to internal rotation and thus its wavefunction samples the full bending coordinate.
Indeed, this work has shown that the global minimum on the ground state potential lies in the Ar⋯SH minimum (some 7 cm−1 lower than the Ar⋯HS configuration) and the ground level wavefunction has local maxima at both linear geometries.
There should therefore be non-zero Franck–Condon overlap between the ground-state Ar⋯SH geometry and levels of the corresponding geometry in the Ã state.
The Ar⋯SH isomer is expected to predissociate at a rate comparable with the SH radical and thus in order to observe such transitions, it will be necessary to collect the early part of the fluorescence profile in the same way that the SH radical fluorescence is collected.
The search for transitions in the Ar⋯SH isomer is currently taking place in our laboratory.
The presence of bound levels in two different isomeric forms on the same potential surface implies that the levels in each minima should exhibit tunnelling splittings.
These splittings should be exquisitely sensitive to the height and shape of the barrier to internal rotation raising the prospect that high resolution microwave spectroscopy could be used to elucidate the finer points of the potential.
In this light we note that Fawzy et al. have calculated the rotational levels and microwave transition intensities in exactly this class of molecule.35,36
Finally, it is appropriate to discuss the suitability of the single determinant reference coupled cluster approach used here.
There is a danger in this type of calculation on excited states that the reference wavefunction in question can be contaminated by other states of the same symmetry.
In the present case the most likely cause of such contamination would be the A′ component of the ground state.
Ideally one would perform multi-reference coupled cluster calculations for such cases.
We chose the method used here on account of its success in previous treatments of the equivalent states in the Ne⋯OH, He⋯OH, Ne⋯SH and He⋯SH complexes.2,3
In our calculations we find that SCF solutions for the different components are so different that the program finds the correct one every time.
We experienced no problems in the convergence of the CCSD(T) and the T1 diagnostic, a measure of the quality of the SCF wavefunction, is reasonable37 (≤0.0216 across the interesting regions of the potential).
There clearly is some contamination of the surface but this value of T1 is not out of line with calculations on other open-shell species.
Hence, whilst this single configuration reference approach is not ideal, we believe the results are valid.
This conclusion is further supported by the good agreement with the empirical potential surface in the region accessible to experiment.
One obvious future extension of this work, besides performing multi-reference calculations, would be to use a basis-set extrapolation method.
Our decision to use the aug-cc-pV5Z basis was made following preliminary investigations with different basis set sizes at the Ar⋯HS geometry, which indicated that the convergence was sufficient as to render the extra cost of the extrapolation to the infinite basis set limit unjustifiable.
We note that ours is already the largest basis set to have been used for such systems.
We have calculated an ab initio potential energy surface for the Ã state of the Ar⋯SH van der Waals complex at the RCCSD(T) level with an aug-cc-pV5Z basis set.
Some 196 ab initio points were calculated and subsequently fitted using the model potential proposed by Bukowski et al.
Low-lying vibrational levels supported in this potential have been calculated using the DVR method.
The ab initio surface is compared with the experiments of the Miller group and is shown to reproduce well the experimental rotational constants although the calculated energy level spacings are systematically low by up to 5%.
In contrast to the empirical surface we have calculated the potential across the full (R, γ) configuration space.
This has allowed us to calculate the bound levels in the Ar⋯SH linear configuration potential well.
Transitions to these levels have not, the best of our knowledge, been assigned in any available spectrum and the reasons for this are discussed.
Pressure induced phase transition and amorphization of Na3ONO2
The high pressure behavior of Na3ONO2 has been investigated by Raman spectroscopy and angle-dispersive X-ray diffraction from synchrotron radiation by using the diamond anvil cell technique.
Pressure induced phase transitions and finally amorphization are observed.
Starting from cubic symmetry at ambient conditions Na3ONO2 transforms to a rhombohedral high pressure phase at 0.7 GPa.
Beyond 14.1 GPa, the crystalline structure destabilizes and amorphous state is achieved.
Na3NO3, known since 1937, was first regarded as sodium orthonitrite.1
In 1977, using single crystal X-ray diffraction, the true nature of the compound was discovered to be sodium oxide nitrite, Na3O(NO2), with a cubic anti-perovskite type structure.2–4
The NO2– ion, disordered at room temperature, occupies the cuboctahedral intersticies formed by the 12 Na+ ions of the (Na3O)+ framework.
Recent neutron scattering studies5 have shown that, upon cooling, Na3ONO2 undergoes crystallographic phase transitions from a cubic (space group Pm3̄m) to a tetragonal M-Na3ONO2 (space group I4/mcm) structure at 240 K, then to a tetragonal T-Na3ONO2 (space group P4/mbm) structure at 178 K, and to a tetragonal TT-Na3ONO2 (space group P4̄21m) structure around 68 K, due to one discontinuous and two continuous ordering processes of the nitrate ion.
The high pressure behavior of Na3ONO2, particularly with regard to the possibility of pressure induced formation of the still unknown NO33– ion, has not been examined.
This Communication reports the results of X-ray powder diffraction studies of Na3ONO2 at high pressures up to 18 GPa at room temperature and 573 K, respectively.
Na3ONO2 was prepared by the solid state reaction of sodium oxide (Na2O) and sodium nitrite (NaNO2) as previously described.4
The crystal structure has been determined at ambient conditions using X-ray and neutron diffraction data.2–5
The high pressure experiments were carried out in a diamond anvil cell (DAC) apparatus.
The sample was loaded in a hole of T301 steel gasket in a glove box and no pressure transmitting medium was used due to the severely hygroscopic character of the sample.
The pressure was calibrated by the ruby luminescence method.6
The angle-dispersive X-ray powder diffraction experiments (λ = 0.4154 Å) in a DAC were performed at the beam line ID9 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), Grenoble, France.
Diffraction patterns were recorded on an image plate and then integrated by using the program FIT2D.7
Raman spectra were collected at room temperature by a Jobin-Yvon LabRAM laser microscope Raman system using a CCD detector with excitation line 632.8 nm (He–Ne laser).
The change of Raman spectra of the sample with increasing pressure is shown in Fig. 1.
At ambient condition, two Raman modes, the δ mode and the νas mode of the NO2– ion,3 are observed.
Both Raman modes show a trend to higher frequencies as a function of pressure.
For the δ mode, the ratio of dω/dP is estimated as 2.13 cm–1 GPa–1.
The νas mode is located near the Raman peak of diamond, which was used as the high pressure cell anvils, and overlaps with the diamond peak during the compressing process after 10.3 GPa and the dω/dP is estimated as 1.44 cm–1 GPa–1.
This enables us to determine the mode Grüneisen parameter , which is evaluated at zero pressure as .
The zero pressure bulk modulus, K0, is estimated as 47.5 GPa for the high pressure phase which is obtained from X-ray diffraction analysis (see later).
Then γG are calculated as 0.125 for the δ mode and 0.052 for the νas mode, respectively.
The intensity of the δ mode decreases with increasing pressure, it is observed up to 12.4 GPa, and it completely disappears at 14.1 GPa.
None of the Raman peaks recover and no Raman active peak, i.e. neither the Raman modes of NO2– nor the hypothetical NO33–, which are possible reaction products, could be observed during the decompressing process from 17.4 GPa to 0.2 GPa.
These results indicate that bonds between N–O in the sample are cleaved above a pressure of 14.1 GPa, and imply that the pressure induced structural conversion is an irreversible process.
Fig. 2 shows the typical XRD patterns of the sample under various pressures during the compressing processes.
Using the program GSAS,8 the Rietveld refinements were carried out for all of the diffraction patterns.
The 4th profile function in GSAS was adopted since this function uses the microstrain broadening description9 and is more suited to high pressure conditions than other profile functions in GSAS.
The results reveal that Na3ONO2 loses its cubic (space group Pm3̄m) symmetry and transforms to a rhombohedral (space group R3̄m) high pressure phase (R–Na3ONO2) at about 0.7 GPa.
The main structural feature of the anti-perovskite structure remains unchanged during the pressure induced phase transition process due to the similarities of the diffraction patterns to the cubic structure.
Fig. 3 shows a typical refinement result of the powder pattern at 1.3 GPa during compression, in which the background of diffraction pattern is removed first and the refinement converged to Rp = 14.3%, Rwp = 18.7%.
Fig. 4 shows the lattice parameters of R–Na3ONO2 as a function of pressure.
As a result of the pressure induced distortion the perfect cubic framework of (Na3O)+ transforms to a rhombohedral symmetry, the unit cell angle changes from 90° at ambient conditions to 90.92° at 0.7 GPa, and then gradually to 94.68° at 10.1 GPa.
When the pressure is increased up to 11.9 GPa, the ratio between intensities of reflections and background in the diffraction pattern decreases.
After 14.5 GPa the crystalline structure of Na3ONO2 is destabilized and an X-ray diffraction amorphous state is achieved.
The sample remains amorphous when the pressure was increased up to 18 GPa, as it does upon decompressing down to 0.5 GPa.
This behavior of pressure induced amorphization is in agreement with the high pressure Raman results.
The reason for the change from crystalline state to an amorphous one seems to be a proceeding decomposition of the sample.
This decomposition proceeds via cleavage of N–O bonds instead of structural separation into the normal decomposition products Na2O and NaNO2 which is shown by the missing reflections in the X-ray diffraction patterns as well as the lack of any NO2–ν or δ modes in the Raman spectra of the sample after it was compressed with more than 14.5 GPa.
As another result from the lack of Raman modes we can exclude the desired formation of the hypothetical NO33– ion.
The product, possibly a mixture of different phases, does not crystallize again during decompressing and may be inhibited by its topological features because of the lack of activation energy which is necessary for the rearrangement in the solid state.
The pressure induced amorphization has attracted intensive attention from a fundamental viewpoint over the last two decades.10–13
Amorphous solids, which have no long-range order and are frozen into a particular structural arrangement, are metastable with respect to crystalline phases.
The different mechanisms of pressure induced amorphization were proposed pertaining to special compounds.
One mechanism suggests a negative pressure dependence of the melting temperature, thus the extension of the melting curve would pass through the amorphization pressure at room temperature, as observed in ice-I, SiO2, and Ca(OH)2 cases of pressure induced amorphization.10–12
For Na3ONO2, a slow decomposition instead of melting occurs on heating up to 623 K at normal pressure, this encouraged us to perform high temperature high pressure experiments in order to check the possible negative pressure dependence of the decomposition temperature.
Using an internal heating DAC device, the high pressure angle-dispersive X-ray powder diffraction experiments at a temperature of 573 K were carried out to compare with the room temperature results.
Firstly we increased the pressure up to 5 GPa, then heated to 573 K and remained at this temperature, then increased the pressure up to 15 GPa.
The impurity peaks of Na2O and NaNO2, which are products of decomposition at ambient condition, are observed together with those of Na3ONO2 in the XRD patterns measured under a pressure range of 5–12 GPa.
Compared to room pressure where the decomposition temperature is 623 K, the relative lower decomposition temperature under higher pressure conditions reveals the characteristic of pressure induced structural destabilization of Na3ONO2.
The X-ray reflections disappear upon compression beyond 13 GPa at 573 K, this pressure is a little lower than the amorphization pressure of 14.5 GPa at room temperature.
Therefore the negative pressure dependence of decomposition and amorphization temperature was observed.
In addition to some general interest in the high pressure behavior of Na3ONO2, the orientational disorder of nitrite ion inside the sodium oxide framework is of special interest.
The orientational disorder is expected to be reduced under high pressure while the sodium oxide framework transforms from cubic symmetry to the lower rhombohedral symmetric structure, then it has lost its translational symmetry in the amorphous state.
However, the diffraction methods could not really distinguish dynamic disorder phenomena due to the measured patterns being averaged over space and time.
The relative poor quality of the high pressure diffraction data, due to stress distribution in the high pressure cell without pressure transmitting medium as well as strong preferred orientation phenomena of the sample, hampered us from obtaining clear information on the evolution of orientational disorder of NO2– under pressure.
Therefore the change of the orientational disorder, if present, in the pressure induced decomposition remains unclear.
Very recently, solid state nuclear magnetic resonance techniques have been used to study the NO2– disorder phase transition behavior change upon cooling,14 and this technique may be applied to disclose the corresponding orientational disorder behavior for the high pressure phase in the future.
The behavior change of the relative unit cell volume of R–Na3ONO2 with pressure is shown in Fig. 5.
The equation of state of R–Na3ONO2 could be fitted into the second order Birch equation of state, in which the pressure derivative of the bulk modulus K0′ remains as .415
The zero pressure bulk modulus (K0) is estimated as 47.5 GPa.
It indicates that R–Na3ONO2 is a soft high pressure phase, which could work well as a pressure transmitting medium itself in DAC during high pressure experiments.
In summary, Na3ONO2 has been investigated by in situ high pressure angle-dispersive X-ray diffraction from synchrotron radiation and Raman spectroscopy.
A phase transition from cubic symmetry at ambient conditions to a rhombohedral phase at a pressure of around 0.7 GPa is observed.
Beyond 14.1 GPa, the crystalline structure destabilizes and an amorphous state is achieved.
The negative pressure dependence of the decomposition temperature of the sample reveals the mechanism of the pressure induced amorphization.
The liquid–liquid coexistence of binary mixtures of the room temperature ionic liquid 1-methyl-3-hexylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate with alcohols
Precise coexistence curves are reported for the liquid–liquid phase transition of binary solutions of the room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) 1-methyl-3-hexylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (C6mim+BF4−) in a series of alcohols (1-butanol, 1-pentanol, 2-butanol, and 2-pentanol).
The phase diagrams are determined by measuring the temperature dependence of the refractive index in the two phases of samples of critical composition.
The critical data of the systems are in the region predicted for the model fluid of equal-sized, charged, hard spheres in a dielectric continuum, the so-called restricted primitive model (RPM).
Therefore, the phase transition can be classified as essentially driven by Coulomb interactions.
The effective exponents βeff determined are close to the universal Ising value, where the deviations are found to be negative, when the volume fraction or the mass fraction are chosen as concentration variable.
The negative values of the first Wegner correction indicate non-uniform crossover from Ising to mean-field criticality.
The diameter of the coexistence curves shows the non-analytic temperature dependence typical for Ising systems.
Recently we have reported a survey on the location of the liquid–liquid phase transition1 in binary solutions of room temperature ionic liquids (RTIL) in water and in a series of alcohols.
The RTILs considered contain a 1-methyl-3-alkylimidazolium cation (Cnmim+, n = 4, 6, 8) and the PF6− or BF4− anion.
A first detailed investigation of critical properties of such systems concerned the viscosity in binary mixtures of the RTIL C6mim+BF4− with 1-pentanol.2
Ising criticality with crossover to regular behaviour was observed in accordance with viscosity measurements on other solutions of low melting salts.3–5
In this work, we continue investigating critical properties of binary mixtures of RTILs with non-ionic fluids analysing coexistence curves of solutions in alcohols.
While in ref. 1, separation temperatures were determined by visual inspection when cooling down homogenous mixtures, in this work, we investigate flame sealed samples of critical composition by a laser technique.
We determine the refractive index of the coexisting phases and of the one-phase region as function of the temperature applying the minimum beam deflection method.
This highly accurate method6–10 allows determining critical exponents, which cannot be achieved by the visual method applied in ref. 1 and in the work of other authors, who reported phase diagrams of other RTILs in alcohol solutions.11–13
Coexistence curves of solutions of RTILs are of technical interest in view of applications in chemical engineering as reaction media and in separation processes.14,15
Reactions have been proposed that, taking advantage of phase transitions, enable elegant separation of products, catalyst and solvent by small changes of temperature or composition.16
Clearly, the knowledge of coexistence curves is essential for designing such processes.
From a scientific point of view, RTILs are of interest for studies of the nature of the critical point in liquid–liquid phase transitions driven by Coulomb interactions.
We recall that Ising criticality, generally observed in fluid phase transitions,30 requires short-range r−n interactions with n > 4.97 (ref. 17,18) as driving potential.
Different critical behaviour is expected when long-range interactions17–20 drive the phase transition.
Mean field criticality of the van der Waals (vdW) type was conjectured in the case of Coulomb forces.21
First measurements of the coexistence curve and of the turbidity of the solution of triethylhexyl ammonium triethylhexyl ammonium borate (N2226+B2226−) in biphenyl ether yielded indeed vdW mean field criticality,22,23 which stimulated theoretical24,25 and experimental work.
However, later experiments on this system, using samples that were tempered for some days before the measurement, did not confirm the observations of mean field criticality4,7 but reported Ising behaviour.
Measurements on other Coulomb systems, e.g. solutions of tetrabutyl ammonium picrate8,26 (N4444Pic) or ethyl ammonium nitrate27–29 (EAN) in higher alcohols also yielded Ising exponents for all properties.8,10,26
With the exception of the work refs. 22 and 23 all experiments3–5,7,8 and most simulations30–33 indicate that phase transitions driven by Coulomb interactions also belong to the Ising universality class.
Nevertheless, this matter is still under discussion.34,35
The salts investigated have a rather low melting point if compared to typical inorganic salts.
The critical temperatures Tc of the solutions are near room temperature.
Thus, mK-accuracy can be achieved easily.
For a review, see .refs. 36–38
However, all experiments remain suspect, because of the limited chemical stability of the organic salts.
The so-called Pitzer salt N2226+B2226− is a notoriously unstable compound.4,7
Consequently; rather different figures for Tc have been reported.
Instability of Tc during the measurements may also cause erroneous conclusions.7
The solutions of the picrates (NR4+Pic−) also cannot expected to be perfectly stable, because, after all, the picrates are explosives.
The EAN–octanol solution decomposes already 20 K above the consolute temperature.27
Therefore, it is worthwhile to investigate the critical properties of solutions of RTILs, which now are commercially available in good quality, chemically stable, and therefore well suited for accurate measurements.
Corresponding states analysis of the location of the consolute point enables to distinguish phase transition that are driven by Coulomb interactions from those determined by solvophobic interactions.39
We have carried out such an analysis of the location of the consolute point based on a survey of more than 200 mixtures of RTILs.1
The reduced variables are defined by the restricted primitive model (RPM), a model fluid of equal sized, charged, hard spheres in a dielectric continuum.
Phase transitions with reduced critical data near the RPM figures are termed Coulombic, because the phase transitions are expected to be driven by Coulomb forces.36,39
The energy scale defining the reduced temperature T* is set by the Coulomb energy of the charges q± at the contact separation σ in a continuum with the dielectric constant ε.
The reduced density is defined by the total number density of the ions ρ = (N+ + N−)/V and the volume σ3.
Monte Carlo simulations, which are accompanied by finite-size scaling techniques, yield the critical point of the RPM at Tc* = 0.049, ρc* = 0..0830–33
Binary solutions of organic salts in solvents of small ε, e.g. in higher alcohols have their consolute point in that region.
In water, where the phase transition is driven by hydrophobic interactions, which are short-range, the reduced critical data (Tc* = 0.6 and ρc* =0.1) become much larger, which is in the region typical for phase transitions driven by solvophobic interactions.1,24,36,39
Similar values apply for phase transitions of non-ionic systems,24 where vdW forces set the energy scale.
The remarkable result in ref. 1 was a nearly linear relation between Tc* and ε of the solvents.
Including water and higher alcohols, this observation suggests a continuous change from Coulomb phase transitions to such driven by solvophobic interactions with ε as the determining parameter.
The nature of the critical point in ionic systems is a puzzling problem.
To start with, the thermodynamic limit does not exist in systems with particles interacting by r−1 Coulomb forces.
The thermodynamic limit exists only for r−n potentials with n > .317
However, in ionic systems, long-range Coulomb interactions become effectively short-range40,41 because of shielding due to Debye–Hückel charge ordering, so that the thermodynamic limit exists.42
Monte Carlo simulations of the RPM yield Ising critical exponents30,32,33 or, at least, are consistent with Ising values.31
Ising critical behaviour is also obtained for the general primitive model, where both, size and charges of the ions may be different.43,44
However, in ionic solutions other long-range interactions may influence the criticality.
Charge-induced dipole interactions and the so-called charge cavity interactions that vary as r−4 are present.45
In 2.1 we will outline that in cases when long-range r−n interactions with 3 < n < 5 determine the phase transition the critical exponents will deviate from the Ising values.
However, Debye–Hückel charge ordering can be expected to shield all electrostatic interactions, so that all long-range interactions, e.g. the mentioned charge-induced dipole interactions may become effectively short range.40,41
Therefore, the conservative expectation is: Ising criticality with crossover to vdW mean field behaviour at larger separation from the critical point.26,46,47
The crossover is determined by the Ginzburg temperature.48
Theory predicts a Ginzburg temperature for Coulomb phase transitions, which is large if compared to non-ionic systems and therefore implies a non-classical Ising region that is even larger than in non-ionic systems.49,50
In variance to this prediction, experiments indicate a crossover to vdW mean field criticality in a smaller temperature region above the critical temperature than in normal non-ionic systems.26
Semi-empirical crossover theory allows describing the experiments,46–49 but a physical explanation is not available.
A hypothesis, which could explain the reported crossover at rather small separation from the critical point, is a scenario involving a tricritical point.
A tricritical point arises, when a line of second order transitions cuts the coexistence curve at the critical consolute point.17,51
Even if this condition is not exactly met, the coupling of the two fluctuations is expected to change critical properties, e.g. the shape of the coexistence curve.52
In ionic fluids, order transitions between an insulating and a conducting state or between a uniform fluid and a charge ordered state53 might be thought of.
Therefore, precise measurements of coexistence curves are required to judge the validity of those theoretical reasoning.
In this work, we present measurements of the coexistence curves of solutions of C6mim+BF4− in the alcohols 1-butanol, 1-pentanol, 2-butanol and 2-pentanol.
In samples of critical composition we determine the refractive index in the homogeneous phase above Tc and in the two phases below Tc using the minimum beam deflection method.6
The coexistence curves are calculated from the refractive index data and compared with the results obtained by determining the separation temperatures in a set of mixtures of given concentration1.
The power n of r−n potentials may be written n = d + s, where d is the dimension of the system.
For s ≥ 2 − ηsr the potential is termed short range and phase transitions determined by such potential belong to the Ising universality class17,51.η is the so-called Fisher exponent, which corrects the classical Ornstein–Zernicke correlation function and assumes the value ηsr = 0.03 in (d = 3)-Ising systems.
The common scenario for fluid phase transitions driven by short-range interactions is Ising criticality in the asymptotic region with crossover to vdW mean field behaviour at large separations from the critical point.48
For s < 0 the thermodynamic limit does not exist.17
Potentials with 0 < s < 2 − ηsr are termed long-range potentials.
Theory predicts for potentials with 0 < s < d/2 the following set of critical exponents19,20ν = 1/s, η = 2 − s, γ = 1,which are termed mean field exponents.
The exponents ν and γ determine the temperature dependence of correlation length ξ and susceptibility χ, respectively.
The vdW mean field exponents, conventionally called mean field exponents, result from a mean field theory for fluids with particles interacting by a short-range potential.
The exponents given in eqn. (2) become identical with the vdW mean field exponents for s = 2.
Based on the hypothesis that thermodynamic functions are homogeneous functions, relations between the various critical exponents have been derived,17,51 which served as a guide in the development of renormalisation group theory of critical phenomena.
For convenience, we give the four relations and apply them to calculate the other mean field exponents:γ = (2 − η)ν, γ = β(1 − δ), γ = 2 − α − 2β, dν = 2 − α.
The last relation of eqn. (3), termed the hyperscaling relation, applies only for d ≤ 4.
Therefore, d = 4 is termed critical dimension dc.
The critical exponent of the specific heat is denoted by α, the exponent δ relates the field to the order parameter at critical temperature.
In the context of the phase transitions of fluids, the exponent δ determines the divergence of the osmotic susceptibility χ, when, at critical temperature, the variable X of the composition approaches the critical value:χ ∼ |X − Xc|1−δ.
The osmotic susceptibility can be determined by measuring the scattering intensity.
The mean field exponents (eqns. (2)) satisfy the relation γ = (2 − η)ν.
The other two relations determining γ and the hyperscaling relation can be used to calculate the exponents α, β and δ yieldingα = 2 − d/s, β = (d − s)/2s, δ = (d + s)/(d − s).For s = d/2 the exponents α, β, γ, and δ agree with the vdW mean field coefficients 0, 1/2, 1, 3, respectively.
Only if d = 4 the exponents ν and η also agree with the vdW mean field values.
However, theoretical analysis requires that for long-range interactions the critical dimension dc depends also on the power of the potential according dc = 2s.17
Furthermore, the dimension d in the hyperscaling relation has to be replaced by the critical dimension.
With this setting, the coefficients α, β, γ and δ agree with the vdW mean field values whenever long-range interactions drive a phase transition, while ν, η assume the vdW mean field values only for s = 2.
First simulations54,55 of fluids with long range potentials 0 < s < 2 yield β/ν = 0.8 for s = 1 and d = 3.
This result is between the estimates β/ν = 1 resulting from eqns. (5) and β/ν = 1/2 obtained with dc = 2, while the Ising value is β/ν = 0.515.
Phase transitions in fluids that are driven by short-range interactions belong to the Ising universality class.
However, the simple power laws involving the universal critical Ising exponents are valid only in the asymptotic region near the critical point.
In general a crossover theory48 should be applied to analyse the date in a wide temperature region.
In fluid mixtures the asymptotic power laws commonly hold in the region τ = |T − Tc|/Tc < 10−3.
In the region 10−3 < τ < 10−2 corrections to scaling56,57 by power series in τ may suffice.
Considering the coexistence curve, the difference ΔX of the composition in the two coexisting phases vanishes as the critical temperature Tc is approached according to the following scaling law termed Wegner expansion:|Xu − Xl| = Bτβ (1 + B1τΔ + B2τ2Δ + ⋯).
Xu and Xl represent the compositions in the upper and in the lower phase, respectively.
While the exponents β = 0.325 and Δ = 0.51 are universal for an Ising critical point, the amplitudes B of the coexistence curve and the amplitudes of the correction terms are specific to the system, but not independent.
There are rather strict conditions on size and sign of the terms in the Wegner expansion.
However, regular terms, which are not part of the Wegner expansion, may also contribute to the fits of the experimental data.47,54,55
Therefore, we apply the expansion (6) just as a tool to fit the data and do not claim to get Wegner coefficients in its strict sense from the data analysis.
The diameter Xm = (Xl + Xu)/2 is also a non-linear function of τ and may be represented56,57 by the seriesXm − Xc = Aτ + Cτ2β + Dτ1−α (1 + D1τΔ + …)involving the critical exponent α of the specific heat with α = 0.11.
Note, that in a vdW mean field system with α = 0 and β = 1/2 the diameter becomes a linear function of τ, thus satisfying the rule of the rectilinear diameter.
The temperature dependence of the diameter has been a matter of controversy for a long time.58
The 2β term is commonly regarded as a spurious contribution, which occurs when a “wrong” concentration variable56,57 is chosen for the data analysis.
This qualification of the 2β term, however, has been questioned recently.59
Furthermore; the deviation from rectilinear diameter is often small and not observable in many cases.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine uniquely the various coefficients in eqn. (7) in a numerical analysis of experimental data.
On experimental grounds, many choices for the composition variable X may be used with equal validity e.g. the mole fraction x, the mass fraction w or the volume fraction φ.
There is no a priory reason to choose one variable over the other.
Japas and Levelt Sengers named some criteria for selecting the best variable:60 simple scaling laws should hold over the largest range, where β assumes the Ising value; the critical composition should be near 0.5 and the coexistence curve should be almost symmetrical.
The asymmetry should be determined by the (1 − α) anomaly only.
Therefore, in the data analysis various choices of the concentration variables may be considered.
If, e.g. the coexistence curve is determined by measuring the transition temperatures in a series of samples of given composition, the mole fraction x or the mass fraction w are known and appear to be the natural choices to represent the composition.
In general, any concentration variable X can be transformed into a certain desired new variable Y by a transformation61 of the formIf the mole fraction x is transformed into the mass fraction w, the parameter p becomes p = M2/M1, where M1 is the molar weight of the compound with mole fraction x.
In general the parameter p may depend on temperature and composition as, e.g., in the transformation of the mole fraction x into the volume fraction φ, where p = V2/V1 is the ratio of the partial molar volumes.
As an approximation to the volume fraction an ideal volume fraction φ0 may be defined, in which the excess volume is neglected and p = V20/V10 is given by the molar volumes of the pure components.
The transformation eqn. (8) may also be applied to construct a symmetrical coexistence curve represented in terms of a new variable.
The transformation of the mole fraction x into a variable, which fixes the critical composition to Y = 0.5 requires p = xc/(1 − xc).
The thermodynamic analysis of Anisimov et al62. appears to remove the arbitrariness of the composition variable.
In the Landau theory the free energy density is expanded.
In this thermodynamic potential, the variable is the density and the corresponding field is the chemical potential.
Therefore, in mixtures the number density (concentration) of one of the components should be chosen as variable, which is ρ1 = φ1/V10.
Because in the investigated temperature range the molar volume V10 is changing very little, the volume fraction is also an appropriate concentration variable.
The density is not identical with the order parameter M.
The order parameter M is a linear combination of density and entropy density, where the (1 − α) term in eqn. (7) represents the entropy density2Mu,l = ±Bτβ (1 + B1τΔ + …) − Aτ − Dτ1−α.Eqns.
(6) and (7) result as difference or sum of the two branches given by eqn. (9).
The order parameter M is the variable in the crossover theory.47,48
The application of this rather involved approach is outside the scope of this work.
If the phase diagrams are determined by measurements of the refractive index of the phases in the sample, the refractive index n or the Lorenz–Lorentz function (n2 − 1)/(n2 + 2) may directly be taken as measure for the composition.
Otherwise, the Lorenz–Lorentz relation can be used to determine the concentration.
The Lorenz–Lorentz relation connects the averaged polarizability 〈αi〉 and the number densities ρi = Ni/V of the components of a mixture to the refractive index, where Ni is the number of particles of the component labelled i.
For a binary mixture we have
The averaged polarizabilities 〈α1〉 and 〈α2〉 are nearly independent of composition and temperature.
With the total number density ρ = ∑iNi/V and ρi = xiρ the Lorenz–Lorentz relation may be reformulated in terms of the mole fractions xi or in terms of the volume fractions φi = ρiVi.
For a binary mixture the Lorenz–Lorentz relation reads in terms of the mole fraction x of the component labelled 1The density may be written in terms of the partial molecular volumes vi = Vi/Ni asFor pure compounds eqn. (10) becomeswhere 〈α1〉0 and vi0 denote the average molecular polarizability and the volume per molecule in the pure components, respectively.
In many applications, the Lorenz–Lorentz function eqn. (10) is identified with the ideal expression based on the parameters of the pure compounds:
In our analysis, it turns out to be necessary to supplement the ideal expression by an excess term, which takes care of excess volume and excess contributions to the polarizabilties.
With the Porter-Ansatz for the excess function and the assumption that the excess function assumes their maximum value at critical composition we getK = Kid[1 + 4Y (1 − Y)(Kc − Kcid)/Kcid],where Kc is the value of the Lorenz–Lorentz function at critical composition.
The variable Y was defined in eqn. (8), where p = xc/(1 − xc).
Eqn. (15) is used in the final data analysis.
Samples of critical composition were prepared for solutions of the RTIL C6mim+BF4− in alcohols (1-butanol, 2-butanol, 1-pentanol and 2-pentanol).
The alcohols with certified purity (1-pentanol (Fluka) > 99%, 1-butanol (Fluka) (HPLC), 2-butanol (Fluka) > 99.5%, and 2-pentanol (Sigma-Aldrich) > 99%) were used without further purification.
The ionic liquid C6mim+BF4− was purchased from Solvent Innovation.
Standard NMR-, MS- and chromatographic analysis did not show impurities.
Traces of water were removed from the salt by keeping it for three days at 60 °C under oil-pump vacuum and storing it in a desiccator.
Solutions were made up by weight with a precision of ±0.1 mg.
The critical compositions for the systems have been determined before and are given in .ref. 1
The samples were prepared in standard square 10 mm cells (Hellma, PY 221).
The critical solutions were filled into the cells using a syringe and a septum in order to prevent condensation of moisture in the sample.
The samples were flame sealed under vacuum after a pump and freeze procedure.
The criticality of the samples was checked employing the equal-volume criterion.
The cloud points were determined visually by repeated cooling the homogeneous solution in a thermostat (Schott) with glass windows filled with water.
The temperature was determined with an accuracy of 0.01 °C using a Quartz thermometer (Hereus QUAT200).
The refractive index was measured in the uniform phase above the critical temperature and in the two-phase region by means of the minimum beam deflection method.6
The coexistence curves of the system were determined from the refractive indices of the upper and of the lower phase.
The optical arrangement and further details are described in .refs. 7–9
In order to prevent the formation of meta-stable states the temperature steps were increased when lowering the temperature in the two-phase region.
A waiting time of about 8 h was necessary to achieve a complete phase separation.
Equilibrium was assumed when the two phases were no longer opalescent, and the position of the laser beam on the screen did not change any more.
By checking the critical temperatures before and after the refractive index measurements, we tested the stability of the critical temperatures.
A shift of the critical temperatures of −8 × 10−8 K s−1 was observed during the measuring time and taken into account in the data evaluation.
As the critical temperature, we choose the average between the last measurement in the homogeneous phase and the first point in the two-phase region, which limits the accuracy of the critical temperature to 0.005 K. The data analysis was carried out using the Origin 6 and Mathematica 4 program packages.
The coexistence curves of the binary solutions of C6mim+BF4− in 1-butanol, 2-butanol, 1-pentanol, and 2-pentanol were obtained by refractive index measurements.
In addition, the refractive index of the pure compounds was determined by the same method.
The temperatures and the corresponding refractive index data in the one phase region and in the coexisting phases below Tc are given in the electronic supplement. The upper phase is the alcohol-rich phase and has the lower refractive index.
The small differences of the refractive indices between salt and solvents limit the relative accuracy of the measurements.
In fact, the refractive indices of the alcohols and of the salts are so similar that it is difficult to see the meniscus.
The coexistence curves obtained from the refractive index measurements are shown in Fig. 1.
The reduced temperature τ is plotted as function of K − Kc.
We employ the Lorenz–Lorentz function K as variable instead of the often-used refractive index8,22 because it is more directly related to thermodynamic quantities than the refractive index.
At first, we check the accuracy of the critical composition deduced from the equal volume criterion.
It can be seen that the Lorenz–Lorentz function K in the homogeneous phase and the diameter Km, which is the mean of the K values in the coexisting phases, meet at the critical temperature.
No offset is noticeable, which proves that our samples have the critical composition.
The coexistence curves with K as composition variable are strongly skewed like the top of a banana.
Due to the banana shape, two temperatures correspond to the same K value.
In the upper phase (alcohol-rich phase with the lower refractive index), the variation of K with the temperature is very small.
The variation of the refractive index in the salt-rich, lower phase is much larger.
The coexistence curves of the solutions in 1- and 2-butanol are wider than those in 1- and 2-pentanol.
Obviously, the more polar alcohol can mix with the salt better.
There is little difference between the isomers; the width of the coexistence curves of the secondary alcohols is only slightly larger than that of the primary alcohols.
In the one-phase region, the Lorenz–Lorentz function is reduced linearly with increasing temperature.
This can be expected from the linear decrease of the density with temperature raise.
No indication of a non-analytic critical contribution63 can be seen.
In contrast, the diameter shows a marked nonlinear temperature dependence: the rectilinear diameter rule clearly does not apply.
Estimates of the critical composition based on the rectilinear diameter rule are necessarily far off.
The slope of the diameter has the same sign as the slope in the one-phase region.
The temperature dependence of the diameter is slightly stronger than the temperature dependence of K in the homogeneous phase.
Both, the temperature variation of K in the one phase region and of Km are almost the same for different mixtures.
The curves, which concern the mixture with 1-butanol, are the best fits using eqns. (6) and (7), which will be dicussed in what follows.
In Table 1, we give parameters obtained from fitting different functions to the experimental data of the coexistence curve.
As a routine we apply first a simple power law, where the exponent βeff is a free parameter, and then use the Wegner-type expansions for the fit with up to two coefficients.
In the expansion the exponents β and Δ are fixed, while the amplitudes B, B1, and B2 are the fitting parameters.
The effective exponents βeff are found to be smaller than the Ising value, which may be taken as indication of non-monotonous crossover to mean field criticality.
Accordingly, the first correction term in the Wegner-type expansion comes out negative.
However, conclusions based on the size of the coefficients are difficult, because their values change, when the second correction is included into the fit.
The statistical error estimated for the parameters becomes then unduly large, which shows that the parameters are not independent.
Hence, the expansion with two correction terms is not appropriate, therefore not included in Table 1.
Comparing the deviations from the asymptotic Ising behaviour for the different alcohols no obvious systematic can be seen.
The diameters Km of the coexistence curves are analysed by fitting different approximants of eqn. (7) to the data, where the amplitudes A, C, D and Kc are the fitting parameters, while the exponents are fixed to their universal values.
At first, we employ one-term expansions with Kc and one of the amplitudes A, C, or D as fit-parameters.
In a next step, a two-term expansion is used containing the linear term A and either the 1 − α term D or the 2β terms C.
The relevant results of the fits are given in Table 2.
The fits, which consider only the 1 − α term, are already rather good.
Including the linear term improves the fit although the statistical uncertainty becomes too large.
The value of the corresponding parameter D changes only little when the linear term is included in the fit.
The fits which include the linear and the 2β term are not as good as those, which include the linear and the 1 − α term and in most cases even worse than those that involve the 1 − α term only.
In Fig. 2a we show the log–log plots of ΔK = Kl − Kuvs. the reduced temperature τ for the four systems.
The sets of data points are shifted by an offset for visual clarity.
The points appear to follow straight lines.
Deviations for τ < 10−4 are due to the rather small difference of the refractive index between the phases and due to the limited accuracy of the critical temperature, which was only ±0.005 K. Above τ = 10−4 no change of the direction can be seen although the measurements cover a temperature range up to 10 K from the critical point.
The lines in Figs. 2a and 1 represent the best fits obtained with eqn. (6) with one Wegner correction.
Fig. 2b shows the diameters of all investigated samples as function of the reduced temperature τ in a logarithmic scale.
Again, the curves are shifted by arbitrary factors for a better view.
The curves in Figs. 1 and 2b are the fits with Kc, A and D as fitting parameter.
The banana shape of the coexistence curves obtained shown in Fig. 1 indicates that K is not a good choice of a variable.
Furthermore, in the homogeneous phase the refractive index varies with temperature, although the relative composition of the components is unchanged.
Therefore, composition variables, which are constant in the homogeneous phase, like the mole fraction x or the mass fraction w appear more appropriate.
From the theoretical point of view, the volume fraction φ is the best choice of a concentration variable.
Dividing by the molar volume, which is almost independent of temperature in the critical region, it can easily be transformed into the density required in the advanced theoretical analysis.47,48
In order to investigate the influence of the choice of the variables on the parameters in eqns. (6) and (7), we transform the refractive index data into the concentration variables x, w, and φ.
The data are reanalysed in terms of those variables.
For estimating the mole fraction of a mixture from refractive index data it is necessary to know the refractive indices and the densities of the pure components.
The refractive indices of the pure components were also determined by the minimum deflection method.
Density data of the alcohols are collected from standard sources.64
The densities of the salt have been measured using a pycnometer.2
The resulting molar volume of the salt is Vs = (224.76 + 0.13324 ΔT) cm3 mol−1 agrees rather well with Vs = (227.116 + 0.1575ΔT) cm3 mol−1 (ΔT = T − 318.15 K) obtained by linear interpolation of the volumes of the salts C4mim+PF6−, C8mim+PF6− and C8mim+BF4−,65 which was assumed in the analysis in .ref. 1
The data of the pure compounds required for the transformations are summarized in Table 3.
In the table, we give the refractive index n298, the polarizability α298, the mass densities ρm298, and the linear temperature coefficients n1, α1 and ρ1 of the pure compounds.
In order to check the accuracy of the transformation, we calculate the value of K at the critical point assuming ideal mixing properties and vice versa recalculate the mole fraction of the critical sample from the refractive index data.
As can be seen in Table 4, the relative accuracy of the estimate of K is 0.001, while relative accuracy of the mole fraction is only 0.1.
Both figures are not sufficient for our purpose.
In order to achieve the required accuracy it is necessary to take into account the excess of the mole refraction.
Therefore we apply the correction for non-ideal contributions as given in eqn. (15), which ensures consistent figures for Kc and xc within the accuracy of the measurements.
The excess of the Lorenz–Lorentz function is positive, while pycnometric measurements2 point towards a positive excess volume, which would account for a negative excess of the Lorenz–Lorentz function.
This observation indicates a positive excess of the averaged polarizabilities that overcompensates the effect of the small but noticeable positive excess volume.
Finally we compare the coexistence curves, which are based on the estimates for the composition obtained from the refractive index measurements with the phase diagrams, which are obtained by direct observation of the appearance of the meniscus in samples of given concentration.1
Fig. 3 shows the phase diagrams of the investigated systems with the weight fraction as concentration variable.
As can be seen, there is no substantial difference between the separation curves obtained by the two methods.1
This proves not only the reliability of our analysis, but it shows also that the compounds are sufficiently pure: The maximum of the phase diagram, determined by visual observation of the phase separation in a set of samples of different composition, is identical with the critical concentration.
In three-component systems, this is usually not the case.9
We mention that preliminary measurements with salts, which were not dried, yielded a critical point different from the maximum of the phase diagram.
In Fig. 3, we have included data of other solutions (water, 1-propanol and 1-hexanol) that were obtained by the visual method1 to emphasize the corresponding-state similarity of the phase diagrams.
The coexistence curves in terms of the new variables are shown in Figs. 4.
Representing the coexistence curves in terms of the variables x, w, and φ the banana shape that was found in the representation in terms of the Lorenz–Lorentz relation, see Fig. 1, disappears.
The representation in terms of the mole fraction is still rather skewed, while the mass fraction gives the most symmetrical shape.
In all figures, the coexistence curves of all four systems are very similar.
Only a minor difference between the solutions in the 1-alcohols and the 2-alcohols is noticeable.
The curves of the mixtures with the 1-alcohols appear slightly more narrow and symmetrical than those of the mixtures with the secondary alcohols.
The coexistence curves represented by the concentration variables mole fraction x, weight fraction w and the volume fraction φ are analysed in the same way as done in Section 4.1, where the Lorenz–Lorentz function was the concentration variable.
The results of the fits are given in Table 5.
In the fits, the critical temperatures Tc were fixed to the experimental values.
We start with a fit to a simple exponential with the exponent βeff as a fitting parameter.
With the exception of the temperature dependence of Δx, the analysis of the coexistence curves in terms of the other variables (Δw or Δφ) yield values for the exponent β that are smaller than the Ising value.
When the coexistence curves are represented by the mole fraction, we get figures slightly above or below the Ising value.
The results of the fits by a Wegner-type expansion with one correction term correspond to this analysis: small positive or negative values of B1, when x is the variable, or larger negative figures of B1 when w or φ is chosen.
As can be seen in Table 5, the fits to a single exponential, where the exponent β is a free parameter and to a one-term Wegner expansion with fixed exponents are equally good.
No systematic is noticeable, when the deviations from the Ising value are compared for the different solvents.
The representation of the coexistence curve by the mass fraction requires larger corrections than the volume fraction.
Fits involving two Wegner corrections are not included in the table because of the large uncertainty of the parameters obtained.
In Fig. 5a, we show the log–log plots of Δφ drawn as function of τ for the investigated systems.
The data follow straight lines that are almost parallel.
This indicates a very good representation of the data by an effective exponent, which is used to draw the lines.
It remains to analyse, how the choice of the variables influences the diameter of the coexistence curves.
As can be seen in Figs. 3 and 4 the diameters (Xu + Xl)/2 of the coexistence curves clearly show a nonlinear temperature dependence.
Again, the curves are not detailed enough to allow free fits of all the coefficients in eqn. (7).
Therefore, we start with one correction assuming either an exponent 2β or 1 − α.
As in the analysis of Km, the critical compositions Xc are treated as parameter in the fits.
In Table 6, we display the results of the fits with D as parameters and the fits with the two parameters A and D.
The results of the other fits are given in the electronic supplement. The agreement among the resulting values for Xc between the various fits and the estimates based on the known composition is of the order O(0.01).
Two terms were required to yield a reasonable fit.
In almost all cases, the combination of the linear term with the 1 − α term is superior to that with the 2β term, although the difference is not impressive.
The linear term is always negative.
The linear and the 1 − α term are always of the same order of magnitude but differ in the sign, which indicates that in the fit the parameters are coupled.
In fact, in the two-parameter fit the amplitude D is always about four times of that obtained in the one-parameter fit.
The Fig. 5b shows the diameter with the fit function when the volume fraction is chosen as concentration variable.
Concluding, we state that, independent of the concentration variable; the temperature dependence of the diameter is consistent with the assumption of a linear term and a non-analytic contribution with an exponent 1 − α.
The additional presence of a non-analytic 2β term cannot be excluded.
In this work we have investigated the coexistence curves of solutions of the RTIL C6mim+BF4− in 2-pentanol, 1-pentanol, 2-butanol, and 1-butanol.
For this purpose, we have measured the refractive index in critical samples of critical composition by applying the minimum beam deflection method.
Measurements on mixtures with higher alcohols turned out to be unfeasible because the difference between the refractive indices of the RTIL C6mim+BF4− and the alcohols became too small to allow for reliable measurements.
We first discuss the location of the critical points of the investigated solutions in the RPM phase diagram.
Assuming that the anion is located above the centre of the imidazolium ring and using vdW radii, we estimate for the distance of the ions in an ion pair 4.6 Å, which is in agreement with simulation66 and scattering67 results.
Using the reduced variables of the RPM, the values for the reduced critical temperature Tc* vary from 0.09 to 0.14.
We find a monotonous increase with the dielectric permittivity ε of the solvents, which is 10.2, 12.6, 15.2, and 16.6 for the alcohols 2-pentanol, 1-pentanol, 2-butanol, and 1-butanol, respectively.
The figures estimated for Tc* are above the value of 0.049, predicted by simulations of the RPM.
However, they are much below 0.65, found for this salt in water, where the phase transition is caused by hydrophobic interactions.1
Therefore, we expect that the phase transition is mainly driven by Coulomb interactions.
We note, that the variation of Tc* is in agreement with the first simulation results on ionic solutions.
The reduced critical temperature in mixtures of charged hard spheres and hard spheres68,69 comes out higher than in the RPM and increases further, when the hard spheres are replaced by dipolar hard spheres.68
Considering the reduced density, we find figures below the RPM value of ρc* = 0.08.
No simple correlation exists between the critical density and the dielectric permittivity of the solvents.
The primary and secondary alcohols form a group, where the critical reduced density is higher for the n-alcohols (1-pentanol: 0.063, 1-butanol: 0.065); the corresponding figures for the secondary alcohols are 0.056, and 0.060, respectively.
This indicates that packing effects modify the interactions of the ions with the solvent and influence the location of the critical point.
Such dependence on the structure of the solvent was already noted in the investigation of solutions of N4444+Pic− in alcohols.8
We now turn to a discussion of the nature of the critical point.
The investigation of the coexistence curve is particularly appropriate for this purpose as, the relative change of the exponent β is larger than for the exponents ν or γ, when going from mean field to Ising behaviour.
Therefore, it appears promising to investigate the coexistence curve in order to trace eventual differences in the critical properties of ionic and non-ionic systems.
For our systems, we find effective exponents βeff for the coexistence curve that are near to the Ising value.
Within the accuracy of our measurements, we see no change of βeff with temperature.
The log-log plots Figs. 2a and 5a appear perfectly linear.
No curvature or change of the slope can be seen indicating a sharp crossover within a small temperature range.
A quantitative analysis of the corrections to scaling depends on the choice of the variable chosen to represent the coexistence curve.
Therefore, we will discuss this matter using the criteria given by Japas and Levelt Sengers.60
The mass faction is the variable, which yields critical points near w = 0.3, which is the value nearest 0.5 obtained for the set of variables considered.
The mole fraction gives the most asymmetric location of the critical point, which is xc = 0.11 for 2-butanol and 0.14 for 1-pentanol.
With K as variable, the critical compositions are Kc = 0.24 for all alcohols.
The volume fraction yields similar figures.
Clearly, the symmetry criterion supports the mass fraction, where wc = 0.3.
Judging, however, by the value found for the effective exponent βeff the mole fraction appears to be the best choice followed by the mass fraction.
The quantitative analysis of the diameter anomaly also rests on the chosen variable.
Here, the best choice appears to be the Lorenz–Lorentz function, because in the fit with one variable, the 1 − α term gives by far the best representation of the data and, furthermore, the amplitude D is almost unchanged when the linear temperature dependence of the diameter is taken into account.
From the phenomenological point of view, it can be said, there is no clear evidence why one of the variables should be preferred.
However, according to the theoretical analysis of Anisimov et al62. there is no ambiguity about the choice of the variable: The density of one component is the appropriate variable, which is the volume fraction divided by the molar volume.
Because the molar volume is changing very little in the investigated temperature range, it is trivial matter to transform the fit results for the volume fraction into such of the concentration.
Unfortunately, the analysis in terms of the crossover theory47,48 is not trivial and merits a separate paper.
Accepting the volume fraction as the best variable βeff is found to be significantly smaller than the Ising value.
The figures are in general agreement with the behaviour observed on the alcohol solutions of N4444+Pic−.8 However, for solutions of N4444+Pic− in long-chain alcohols like tetradecanol positive deviations from the Ising value were found, which became smaller with increasing value of ε and negative for 2-propanol.
2-propanol was the only alcohol with chain length <10 considered in this investigation.
In the work reported here, the polarities of the alcohols are between that considered in ref. 8 but near to that of 2-propanol.
Accordingly, we find negative deviations when the variables K, w, or φ are used.
Negative deviations indicate non-uniform crossover to mean field behaviour at higher temperatures.
No regular variation of βeff with the dielectric permittivity ε of the solvent can be observed.
Quite likely, the ε-range of the solvents used in this work is too small to establish such dependence.
The non-analytic temperature dependence of the diameter of the coexistence curves is a general property of phase transitions in fluids belonging to the Ising universality class.
The amplitude, however, depends on specific properties of the system.
In many systems, the amplitude is too small to be seen.
Substantial deviations from the rectilinear diameter rule are common in systems where the intermolecular interactions themselves depend on the density.
This is the case, e.g. in liquid-gas phase transition of metals, where one phase is an insulator and the other a molten metal.70
In a fluid of charged hard spheres the low-density phase can be pictured as a gas of ion pairs while the high-density phase appears as an expanded melt containing essentially free ions.53
In this picture the effective interactions are indeed density dependent, which may explain the observed irregularity.
With the exception of Pitzer′s system (N2226+B2226− in biphenylether)7 the diameter anomaly observed in the C6mim+BF4− solutions was observed in all other ionic systems investigated.8–10
A substantial diameter anomaly appears to be a signature of ionic systems.
Concluding, we state that the coexistence curves of the investigated systems agree remarkably well in the corresponding state representation.
We state Ising critical behaviour for a set of new nearly Coulomb systems and confirm the earlier results obtained on systems with rather limited chemical stability.
The coexistence curves show Ising critical behaviour with deviations.
No indication of a second maximum in the coexistence curves is noticeable, which is predicted for phase transition with strong coupling to a tricritical point.52
The deviations of the exponent βeff from the Ising value depend on the choice of the order parameter chosen for the analysis.
With the exception of the mole fraction, the analysis in terms of all other possible variables yields a negative deviation from Ising criticality, which may be taken as an indication of non-monotonous crossover.
Deviations from the asymptotic Ising exponent are noticeable in the complete temperature range investigated and not only in the region with τ > 10−2, where deviations from Ising critical behaviour are common.
A sharp crossover, reported from the turbidity measurements58 of solutions of picrates in alcohols, is not observed in the phase diagrams.
Measurements of higher accuracy in the mK-region are desirable, which are expected to show the change of the effective critical exponent from the asymptotic Ising value to the region with negative deviations, while investigations in a wider temperature range should show the increase of βeff towards the vdW mean field value.
Finally, we mention a result, which may be important in respect to applications of the RTILs in separation processes.
Already 10 K below the critical points the refractive index of the alcohol-rich phase is almost identical with that of the pure solvent.
Using the coefficients obtained for describing the coexistence curve, we estimate that the salt content is below 1%, while the equilibrium concentration of the alcohol in the salt-rich phase is substantial.
Reaction of O(3P) with the alkyl iodides: CF3I, CH3I, CH2I2, C2H5I, 1-C3H7I and 2-C3H7I
The kinetics of the reactions between O(3P) and various alkyl iodides (RI) was investigated using the pulsed laser photolysis–resonance fluorescence (PLP–RF) technique at temperatures between 223 and 363 K. The reactions studied were O(3P) + CF3I (1), O(3P) + CH3I (2), O(3P) + CH2I2 (3), O(3P) + C2H5I (4), O(3P) + 1-C3H7I (5), and O(3P) + 2-C3H7I (6).
The Arrhenius expressions (units of cm3 molecule−1 s−1) obtained were: k1(223–363 K) = (8.73 ± 1.29) × 10−12exp{−(216 ± 38)/T}, k2(223–363 K) = (9.88 ± 1.67) × 10−12exp{(183 ± 50)/T}, k3 (256–363 K) = (7.36 ± 0.31) × 10−11 cm3 molecule−1 s−1, k4(223–363 K) = (1.58 ± 0.22) × 10−11exp{(239 ± 39)/T} k5(223–363 K) = (1.10 ± 0.17) × 10−11exp{(367 ± 42)/T}, and k6(223–363 K) = (1.84 ± 0.31) × 10−11exp{(296 ± 46)/T}.
With the exception of k1 and k3, all the other rate coefficients display a negative temperature dependence, which highlights the importance of association complex formation in reactions of O(3P) + RI.
Interest in the reactions of alkyl iodides (RI) with oxygen atoms (O(3P)) stems from a desire to understand the mechanism of these processes, which have multi-channel product pathways on singlet and triplet potential energy surfaces and which involve the initial formation of a R–I–O complex.1–5
Whereas IO elimination is the most important product channel for the smallest iodoalkanes, CH3I and CF3I (e.g., Φ(IO) ≈ 0.8–0.9 for CF3I),6 the presence of a β-position C–H bond in the longer chain iodoalkanes enables the intramolecular abstraction of an H-atom via a five-membered transition state to eliminate HOI with a yield as high as ≈0.8 for e.g., O(3P) + C2H5I.7
The formation of HOI in a spin forbidden process has been used as a laboratory source of HOI, as has the spin allowed formation of IO and R′.
O(3P) + RI → IO + R′ O(3P) + RI → HOI + R′R′ These reactions have found application in experiments designed to provide basic physico-chemical data on these molecules,7,8 and also parameters relevant to their atmospheric chemistry9,10 and photochemistry.11,12
The rate coefficients of reactions which proceed via formation of an association complex that can stabilise and rearrange to form products often display negative temperature dependences, i.e. the rate coefficients increase with decreasing temperature.
This effect has been observed for CH3I, but there are no data describing the temperature dependences of the rate coefficients for larger RI.
In this paper, we present the temperature dependences of the overall rate coefficients for the reactions of O(3P) with CF3I, CH3I, C2H5I, 1-C3H7I, 2-C3H7I and CH2I2.
For CH2I2, C2H5I, and 1-C3H7I these data are the first to be reported at any temperature.
The experiments were carried out at temperatures ranging from 223 to 363 K and pressures of 100 Torr He (or N2) using the pulsed laser photolysis, resonance fluorescence technique (PLP–RF).
For CF3I a systematic investigation of the pressure dependence was carried out at 223 K. The experimental set up for PLP–RF is essentially that which has already been described in the literature13 and is given briefly below.
The reactions were conducted in a thermostatted quartz reaction vessel of ≈500 ml volume with Brewster angle entrance and exit windows which could be heated to prevent condensation of ambient water vapour when working at low temperatures.
Gas flows were regulated by calibrated mass flow controllers, and the pressure was monitored using 100 and 1000 Torr capacitance manometers.
In some experiments CH2I2 was passed through a Teflon needle valve instead of the flow controller, but no significant differences could be observed.
The temperature in the reaction zone was monitored with a J-type thermocouple, and regulated by circulating cryogenic fluid through a jacket.
Typical flow rates were ≈500 cm3 (STP) min−1 (sccm), sufficient to replenish the reaction volume between laser pulses, and prevent build up of products which could result in secondary loss processes of O(3P).
Pulsed photolysis radiation at 351 nm was provided by an excimer laser at a repetition rate of between 2 and 10 Hz.
The photolysis beam intersected the light from an O-atom resonance lamp at the focus of a MgF2 lens that directed fluorescence to a VUV photomultiplier.
The resonance lamp was operated at a total pressure of 3 Torr He, and its emission was filtered by a 1 mm thick CaF2 window, that prevented transmission of shorter wavelength emission from N and H atoms.
Time dependent O(3P) signals were amplified, digitised and counted by a multichannel scaler usually operating at a resolution of 5 μs per channel, and averaging between 1000 and 3000 decay profiles.
Oxygen atoms were produced by the 351 nm photolysis of NO2: NO2 + hν → NO + O(3P) Typically, NO2 concentrations of (6 ± 1) × 1013 molecules cm−3 and laser fluences of 2–12 mJ cm−2 were used, resulting in the formation of approximately (8–50) × 1010 O(3P) cm−3 per pulse.
The approximate sensitivity (S/N = 1) for detection of O(3P) was ≈2 × 1010 atoms cm−3 for a total integration time of 5–10 ms.
An accurate measurement of the concentration of the alkyl iodides is necessary to derive rate coefficients (see below) and was carried out on-line by absorption spectroscopy using a 44 cm cell mounted at the exit of the reaction cell and maintained in a vacuum housing at room temperature.
The intensity of either the 185 or 254 nm line of a low-pressure Hg lamp, was monitored by two photodiodes (one transmission, one reference) to derive the optical density (OD) due to the alkyl iodide.
In separate experiments the dependence of OD185 or OD254 on the concentration of RI was determined by flowing RI diluted in He through an optical absorption cell equipped with a monochromator and a diode array spectrometer to obtain a simultaneous measurement of absorption between ≈210 and 360 nm.
This was converted to a concentration by least squares fitting to evaluated literature spectra,14 enabling effective cross sections at 254 and 185 nm to be derived as: σ254(CF3I) = 4.19 × 10−19, σ254(CH3I) = 1.14 × 10−18, σ185(CH2I2 = 3.33 × 10−17, σ254(C2H5I) = 1.14 × 10−18, σ254(1-C3H7I) = 1.35 × 10−18, σ254(2-C3H7I) = 1.23 × 10−18 cm2 molecule−1.
The commercial gases used in this study had the following stated minimum purity: NO2 (Aldrich 99.5%), He (Linde 99.999%), N2 (Linde 99.999%), CF3I (ABCR GmbH 99%), all other RI (Aldrich, 99%).
All RI samples were vacuum-distilled before use and the gas phase checked for I2 impurity by optical absorption at 450–610 nm.
Only for CH2I2 was I2 detected, at a level of 0.2% of the RI concentration.
For CF3I an upper limit of 0.01% could be determined, and for all other RI this value was <0.1 × 10−3.
In all experiments the concentrations of O(3P) and RI were chosen so that pseudo first order conditions prevailed, i.e. [RI] ≫ [O(3P)] with a value of [RI]/[O(3P)] of between 400 and 8000.
In the absence of secondary loss processes for O(3P), the concentration profile of O(3P) is then given by: [O(3P)]t = [O(3P)]0 exp (−(k([RI] + d)t) where [O(3P)]t is the oxygen atom concentration at time t, and [O(3P)]0 is the initial oxygen atom concentration.
The term d represents the summed loss of O(3P) due to diffusion from the reaction zone and reaction with NO2 and was typically 500–700 s−1 (mainly due to reaction with NO2).
Plots of ln O(3P)-signal versust yield the first-order decay constant, k′, which is related to the bimolecular rate coefficient by: k′ = k[RI] + d The assumption of no significant secondary loss of O(3P) could be tested by demonstrating that variation of the laser fluence, and thus the radical density and degree of conversion of RI had no influence on measured values of k′.
The one exception to this was encountered in experiments with CH2I2, in which formation of CH2I and I occurs directly by photolysis.
This is discussed in detail below.
The O(3P) + CF3I reaction was studied at seven temperatures between 223 and 363 K and at four different pressures from 20 Torr to 310 Torr in He and at 100 Torr in N2 at 223 K. A representative data set displaying O(3P) decays in the presence of various excess concentrations of CF3I (in this case at 243 K) is given in Fig. 1.
A plot of k′ versus [CF3I], the slope of which defines the rate coefficient according to eqn. (ii), is given in Fig. 2 for 223 and 333 K. It is apparent from this figure that the reaction of O(3P) with CF3I has an activation barrier (rate coefficient increases with increasing temperature).
The complete data set, covering temperatures between 223 and 363 K is given in Table 1 and displayed in Arrhenius form in Fig. 3.
Data from previous experimental studies, obtained using both resonance fluorescence detection of O(3P) and laser induced fluorescence detection of IO (the major product, see below) are also displayed in Fig. 3 and listed in Table 2.
The fit line shown is to the Arrhenius expression, k(T) = Aexp(−E/RT), and is described by: k1(223–363 K) = (8.73 ± 1.29) × 10−12exp(−{216 ± 38}/T) The errors in E/R are 2σ random only, returned by the weighted (by 1/σ2) fit to the data presented in Table 1.
The errors in the pre-exponential factor include both 2σ random error (as above for E/R) and also an additional 5% systematic error due to estimated uncertainty in the absorption cross sections of CF3I.
Table 2 compares the rate constants at 298 K and the Arrhenius parameters of this work with those obtained in previous studies.
The results from the most recent studies are in excellent agreement throughout the common temperature range.
Although the temperature dependence of Hölscher et al15. agrees with the present data, the absolute values are somewhat higher, as are those of Atkinson et al16. and the older room temperature studies of Addison et al17. and Watson et al.18
Watson et al. monitored IF formation from the reaction sequence: O(3P) + CF3I → IO + CF3O(3P) + CF3 → F2CO + FF + CF3I → IF + CF3 Given the indirect nature of this determination, the result of (6.5 ± 1.5) × 10−12 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 can be considered in satisfactory agreement with the present determination.
The result of Addison et al., k3 = (1.1 ± 0.3) × 10−11 cm3 molecule−1 s−117 was obtained by direct observation of O(3P) by resonance absorption in the presence of excess CF3I and is a factor of ≈2 larger than the present result.
Atkinson used cavity ring down detection of the IO product to obtain (5.8 ± 1.5) × 10−12 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 at 295 K.
Possible causes for determining rate coefficients that are too high include (a) the presence of reactive impurities (e.g., I2), (b) the secondary loss of O(3P) via reaction with IO or (c) underestimated CF3I concentrations.
As discussed already, all of these potential sources of error could be minimised in the present PLP–RF study.
As mentioned above, IO is a known product of reaction (1).
The thermodynamically accessible product channels (from Gilles et al6.) are: O(3P) + CF3I → IO + CF3O(3P) + CF3I → IF + CF2OO(3P) + CF3I → I + F + CF2OO(3P) + CF3I → I + CF3OO(3P) + CF3I + M → M + CF3IO Product formation in this reaction has been extensively investigated by Gilles et al.,6 who determined that channel (1a) dominates with temperature independent yields of IO of ≈0.8–0.9, whereas no evidence has been found for the formation of CF3O6 or IF.16
Gilles et al6. speculated that an adduct (either CF3IO or CF3OI) could be formed.
They also provide an extended discussion of the earlier literature regarding product formation, which is not repeated here.
However, since the work of Gilles et al., 6 indirect evidence for the presence of the pressure dependent channel at low temperatures (1e) has been given by Bloss et al12. who, in contrast to Gilles et al.,6 observed a pressure dependence in the IO yield at 223 K. In addition, the work of Dillon and Heard19 reveals an increase in the overall rate coefficient at 223 K with increasing pressure.
In agreement with the present work, a pressure dependence of k1 was not observed at room temperature.
In order to examine the presence of pressure effects at low temperatures, we carried out experiments at 223 K in the presence of between 10 and 310 Torr He, and at 100 Torr N2.
The results, shown in Fig. 4, indicate no significant pressure dependence at this temperature, in stark contrast to the result of Dillon and Heard.19
The reason for this discrepancy remains unclear.
Although the present data set weakens the arguments in favour of a termolecular channel, they do not rule it out, as the lack of pressure dependence could also be attributed to the reaction being at the high pressure limit at 10 Torr and 223 K.
The PLP–RF data for CH3I (and the following RI) were obtained as described above, and the pseudo first-order decays and the plots of k′ versus [RI] were qualitatively similar to those for CF3I.
The complete data set obtained for reaction of O(3P) with CH3I is listed in Table 1, and plotted in Arrhenius form in Fig. 5, which also displays results of previous studies.
The temperature dependence of the rate coefficient is given by: k2(223–363 K) = (9.88 ± 1.67) × 10−12exp{(183 ± 50)/T} where the error limits were derived as for eqn. (iii).
The absolute values of the rate coefficient and its temperature dependence obtained in the present study are in excellent agreement with the measurements of Gilles et al6. which were also obtained using mainly O(3P) resonance fluorescence, but with some data obtained using LIF detection of IO.
The data of Hölscher et al.,15 obtained using only LIF detection of IO, agree at temperatures close to 300 K, but are systematically higher by ≈10% at lower temperatures and display a stronger temperature dependence.
The estimate of Kwong et al20. was based on an indirect flow tube study, and is orders of magnitude too low, suggesting that some of the assumptions made to describe the formation of excited I2 (the only product detected) were erroneous, as some of the now recognised product channels were not considered.
The products of this reaction have been examined in detail by Gilles et al.,6 and the possible exothermic channels are listed below: O(3P) + CH3I → IO + CH3O(3P) + CH3I → OH + CH2IO(3P) + CH3I → H + I + HCHOO(3P) + CH3I → I + CH3OO(3P) + CH3I → HI + HCHOO(3P) + CH3I → CH3IO (or CH3OI) The observation of multiple product channels, and a negative temperature dependence are indicative of a complex mechanism, though in this case rearrangement to form HOI via internal abstraction from a five-membered ring is not possible.
Gilles et al6. have determined product yields for IO (40–50%), OH (16%), H (7%), CH3O (<3%) and HI (<5%).
CH2I2 is the only di-iodoalkane investigated in this work, and hence the only one which has an absorption spectrum that extends out to 351 nm, the wavelength of the photolysis laser.
The absorption cross-section of CH2I2 at 351 nm is reported as ≈3.2 × 10−19 cm2 molecule−1,14 which is similar in magnitude to that of NO2, the precursor of O(3P) in these experiments.
As CH2I2 was present in concentrations similar to those of NO2, the photolytic generation of unwanted radicals (i.e. CH2I) at concentrations exceeding those of O(3P) is a potential problem.
CH2I2 + hν (351 nm) → CH2I + IFor experiments with CH2I2, two problems were encountered, which were not apparent for the other RI examined in this study.
Firstly, the signal due to O(3P) was modified by a post laser-pulse offset, which was also observed in the absence of NO2.
This offset signal was constant on the time scales of a typical experiment, suggesting photolytic generation of a non-reactive species that can scatter the light from the resonance lamp, with I atoms from reaction (10) being the obvious candidate.
The data were therefore treated by correcting for the measured offset, or by modifying eqn. (i) to account for time independent offset.
Both gave the same result, and the second option, which saves considerable experimental time, was adopted.
A more serious problem was the observation of a laser fluence dependence in the first-order decay constant of O(3P), with faster decay constants obtained at higher laser fluence.
This clearly indicated that O(3P) was being removed by reaction with CH2I or other reactive species formed in secondary processes.
At laser fluences ≤3 mJ cm−2 values of k′ were, within experimental uncertainty, independent of fluence.
All subsequent experiments were therefore conducted at a laser fluence of ≈3 mJ cm−2 and using higher NO2 concentrations than for the other RI in order to generate sufficient O(3P) for detection.
The data thus obtained are listed in Table 1 and displayed in an Arrhenius plot in Fig. 6.
The somewhat larger experimental uncertainty compared to those of the other RI reflects the problems mentioned above.
Within the experimental uncertainty and the temperature range covered the rate coefficient can be considered independent of temperature, with a value of k3 = (7.36 ± 0.47) × 10−11 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 obtained from a weighted average of the data in Table 1.
The error limits contain both random error (see footnote to Table 1) plus 5% systematic error related to uncertainty in the cross-section of CH2I2.
The present data yield a temperature dependent rate coefficient described by: k4 = (1.58 ± 0.22) × 10−11 exp{(239 ± 39)/T} The room temperature rate coefficient is k4(298 K) = (3.51 ± 0.24) × 10−11 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 whereby the errors contain both random error (see footnote to Table 1) and an estimated 5% systematic error arising from uncertainty in the absorption cross section of C2H5I. This value can be compared with unpublished data of Gilles ((2.38 ± 0.73) × 10−11 cm3 molecule−1 s−1) which was cited by Loomis et al.4
This value is significantly lower than the present result, and thus in contrast to the other data common to this work and the published data of Gilles et al6. which are in excellent agreement.
Previous studies of the dynamics of this reaction have shown the presence of at least two reaction pathways, generating HOI and IO:5,8 O(3P) + C2H5I → HOI + C2H4O(3P) + C2H5I → IO + C2H5 with ≈80–90% of the reaction proceeding via the HOI forming channel at 298 K.7
The negative temperature dependence of k4 is thus consistent with formation of a long lived association complex (i.e. R–I–O) which can rearrange via a five-membered ring to form the products of channel (4a), or dissociate to form R + IO as in channel (4b).
Our data on these two reactions give Arrhenius expressions of: k5 = (1.10 ± 0.17) × 10−11 exp{(367 ± 42)/T}k6 = (1.84 ± 0.31) × 10−11 exp{(296 ± 46)/T} The errors are derived as in eqn. (iii).
The room temperature rate coefficients are: k5(298 K) = (3.79 ± 0.31) × 10−11 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 and k6(298 K) = (4.97 ± 0.38) × 10−11 cm3 molecule−1 s−1, whereby the errors contain both random error (see footnote to Table 1) and an estimated 5% systematic error arising from uncertainty in the absorption cross-section of C3H7I. The room temperature result for 2-C3H7I is in excellent agreement with the value of (5.18 ± 0.44) × 10−11 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 presented by Gilles et al.6
As for C2H5I, the negative temperature dependence of both reactions indicates the formation of an association complex that can rearrange to form both IO and HOI:8 O(3P) + C3H7I → HOI + C3H6O(3P) + C3H7I → IO + C3H7 The yield of IO in reaction (6b) has been determined as 0.21 at room temperature,6 those of HOI or other product channels have not been determined.
The larger rate coefficient for 2-C3H7I compared to 1-C3H7I can be attributed to the six β-position H atoms available for formation of the five-membered ring for C3H7I compared to just two for 1-C3H7I, and to the greater electron density around the C–I bond due to two adjacent electron donating CH3 groups.
Steric effects presumably reduce these effects so that the rate coefficients differ by a factor of only 1.35.
The 298 K rate coefficients from this work are listed in Table 3 and reveal a strong trend in reactivity of various RI towards O(3P) with the slowest rate coefficient provided by CF3I, and the largest by the doubly substituted CH2I2.
The rate coefficients are between 3 and 7 orders of magnitude larger than those observed for reaction of O(3P) with the equivalent non-iodine substituted hydrocarbon, with k(O(3P) + CH3I)/k(O(3P) + CH4) = 3.7 × 106, k(O(3P) + CH2I2)/k(O(3P) + CH4) = 1.50 × 107, k(O(3P) + C2H5I)/k(O(3P) + C2H6) = 7.3 × 104 and k(O(3P) + C3H7I)/k(O(3P) + C3H8) = 4.9 × 103.
Rate coefficients for reaction of O(3P) with CH4 and C2H6 were taken from ref. 21 and for reaction of O(3P) with C3H8 from ref. 22 Such large effects are not observed with substitution by e.g., Cl.
For example, the ratio k(O(3P) + CH3Cl)/k(O(3P) + CH4)) = 34 (rate coefficient for O(3P) + CH3Cl from a compilation23).
The great enhancement in rate coefficient together with the change in sign of its temperature dependence (O(3P) + RH or O(3P) + RBr have positive temperature dependences) indicate a change in mechanism, as does the existence of multiple reaction pathways for O(3P) + RI.
These observations are further indicators of the participation of an association complex, the formation of which may involve charge donation from the electron rich iodine atom to the oxygen atom.
Indeed, as discussed by Gilles et al.,6 the room temperature rate coefficient for reaction of O(3P) with several fluorinated alkyl iodides is correlated with the ionisation potential.
In Fig. 7, we plot the natural logarithm of the 298 K rate coefficients obtained in this work along with those for other selected iodine containing alkanes as a function of ionisation potential.
The rate coefficients for reaction with O(3P) of the mono-substituted iodo-alkanes display a clear negative dependence on ionisation potential.
We note that the trend line in Fig. 7 was derived by fitting only to those data points in which a negative temperature dependence has been established.
When the pre-exponential factor is used in place of the room temperature rate coefficient, the correlation is barely discernible.
The observation of a positive temperature dependence for O(3P) + CF3I may imply that the rate coefficient is influenced by barriers to rearrangement of the association complex, and the dependence of k on ionisation potential may be modified.
The temperature dependence of the reaction between O(3P) and the other fluorinated species is presently unknown.
The data for O(3P) + CH2I2 does not fit well with this trend, possibly reflecting stabilisation of the association complex via involvement of two iodine atoms.1
The rate coefficients obtained at 298 K can be compared to data obtained for the reactions of the same RI with both the OH radical and Cl atoms, which are also listed in Table 3.
With the exception of CH2I2 (for which no rate coefficients for reaction with Cl or OH are available) some interesting trends are observed.
For both OH and Cl the rate coefficient increases with the number of C–H bonds from C1 to C3, with a lower rate coefficient for 2-C3H7I than for 1-C3H7I, reflecting the reduced number of weaker secondary C–H bonds for 2-C3H7I compared to 1-C3H7I. For the reasons discussed above, the relative reactivity of O(3P) with 1-C3H7I and 2-C3H7I is reversed due to the larger number of β H-atoms that can be internally extracted as the association complex rearranges via a five-membered ring transition state to form HOI.
We note that the general trend for the reactivity of O(3P) and Cl towards hydrocarbons, wherein Cl abstraction is usually orders of magnitude faster than O(3P) is reversed for most of the iodine substituted hydrocarbons investigated, again indicating the relatively minor role of abstraction compared to addition–elimination.
Rate coefficients were obtained at different temperatures for the reaction of O(3P) with a series of iodine-substituted alkanes (CF3I, CH3I, CH2I2 C2H5I, 1-C3H7I and 2-C3H7I).
For reaction of CH2I2, C2H5I and 1-C3H7I with O(3P) atoms this work represents the first rate coefficient determination reported at any temperature and for CH2I2, C2H5I, 1-C3H7I, 2-C3H7I with O(3P) atoms the first study of the temperature dependence.
With the exception of CF3I and CH2I2, all the reactions display an increase in rate coefficient with decreasing temperature, and are several orders of magnitude faster than their non-iodine-substituted hydrocarbon analogues.
In the case of CF3I, the pressure dependence was investigated, and, in contrast to previous work, none was found at any temperature down to 223 K. These data substantiate the concept that, at low temperatures, the reactions between O(3P) and RI proceed mainly via formation of an association complex in which O(3P) adds to the I atom, and which can then rearrange to form a number of products.
Nanoassemblies formed from hydrophilic block copolymers and multivalent ions
We recently reported on the controlled formation of highly stable metal hydroxide nanoparticles.
Growth control and stabilization of particles were achieved by performing hydrolysis and polycondensation reactions of polymer-complexed metal cations, the polymers being double hydrophilic block copolymers (DHBCs).
The present paper focuses on the characterization of the intermediate species in the formation process, namely the mixture of multivalent metal cations plus the oppositely charged polyelectrolyte–neutral block copolymers.
Complexation of metal cations by the anionic block of the DHBCs leads to the spontaneous formation of colloidal objects.
Small angle neutron scattering experiments show that the aggregates exhibit a well defined core–corona architecture: the core is compact and homogeneous while the diffuse corona is constituted of polymer segments in a good solvent.
The core formation is due to the water insoluble metal cation–polyacrylate complex while the corona is constituted of the water soluble neutral polymer blocks.
Cryo-TEM images allowed the revelation of well-dispersed inorganic-rich domains.
The presence of the longer neutral blocks prevents macroscopic phase separation of the complex and leads to the formation of hybrid micellar aggregates.
The recent development of nanoparticle-based materials has ushered in a need for reliable preparation routes for stable nanoparticles of controlled properties.
The most important characteristics of nanoparticles are their size, shape, chemical composition, structure and stability.
Colloidal particles of metal hydrous oxides have various applications depending on the nature of the metal ion; they are most commonly prepared by hydrolysis of metal cations in the presence of small complexing agents.
We have recently shown that it was possible to prepare highly stable suspensions of metal hydroxide-based particles with tunable sizes by using well-chosen double hydrophilic block copolymers (DHBC).1
DHBCs have recently known a considerable development; a review on their synthesis and applications was recently published by Cölfen.2
DHBCs containing an anionic complexing block and a neutral block can be used to simultaneously ensure growth and stabilization control of metal hydroxide nanoparticles.1
The controlled formation of metal hydroxide particles was illustrated by the cases of Cu2+, Al3+, La3+ metal ions.3,4
The formation of M(OH)n phases is induced by hydroxylation of metal ions and polycondensation reactions in the presence of the polymers.
Metal cationic precursors can be either Mn+ metal ions (n = 2, 3…) or polycations5 such as the Keggin tridecamer Al137+ or Al3018+ or nanoparticles obtained by controlled partial prehydrolysis of metal ions.
The block copolymers contain an ionizable block, which is polyacrylic acid, and a neutral block which can be polyhydroxyethylacrylate or polyacrylamide.
A detailed investigation of the particle formation mechanisms is necessary in order to better control the particle properties.
Our goal was then to characterize the intermediate species in the formation process.
When anionic–neutral DHBC are mixed with metal cations, the spontaneous formation of colloidal objects is observed.
These aggregates are the precursors for polymer-stabilized inorganic nanoparticles; it is important to characterize them since the characteristics (size, shape) of the resulting metal hydroxide-based particles are a direct function of the characteristics of the precursor aggregates.3,4
In this paper, we want then to report on the characteristics of these colloidal aggregates formed between multivalent metal cations and oppositely charged block copolymers.
The sizes, shapes and microstructures of the cation/copolymer aggregates were examined by using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and small angle neutron scattering (SANS) together with cryo transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM).
The colloidal stability of the nanoassemblies was also investigated.
In this paper, only the case of asymmetric block copolymers constituted of a functional anionic block smaller than the neutral block is treated.
Solutions of Al(NO3)3·9H2O (Aldrich) in water were used as Al3+ salt solutions.
Pure solutions of Al137+ clusters were prepared by controlled prehydrolysis of Al3+ solution (0.1 M) with sodium hydroxide solutions (0.3 M) at 90 °C.
A prehydrolysis ratio h1 = [OH−]/[M] of 2.46 was used.
It was checked by 27Al NMR that the solution contained only Al13 species.
Ultrapure deionized water (MilliQ, Millipore, France) was used for all solution preparations.
The block copolymers used in this study are polyacrylic acid (PAA)-b-polyhydroxyethylacrylate (PHEA) or polyacrylic acid (PAA)-b-polyacrylamide (PAM), whose molecular weights (g mol−1) are indicated close to each block name in the following.
PAA-b-PAM and PAA-b-PHEA block copolymers were provided by Rhodia (Aubervilliers, France), their synthesis was described earlier.6
Before mixing the copolymer with solutions of metal ions, the pH of the copolymer solution is adjusted to 5.5, which means a dissociation degree of acrylic acid functions of about 50%.
Specifications of polymers used in the present work are indicated in Table 1.
The hybrid nanoaggregates described in this paper are prepared by adding copolymer solutions (5 wt.%) into metal ions containing solutions, under fast stirring at room temperature.
Metal concentrations in the final suspensions vary between 5 × 10−3 and 10−1 M.
Dynamic light scattering experiments were run using a Malvern spectrogoniometer, Autosizer 4800, with a 50 mW laser source operating at 532 nm.
Hydrodynamic sizes were measured at 90°.
SANS experiments were run at Laboratoire Leon Brillouin (Saclay, France), on the PACE beam line.
A q (magnitude of the wave vector)-range from 0.004 to 0.45 Å−1 was covered by collecting the data at two distances d = 1 m and 3 m, with respective incident neutron wavelengths of 5 Å and 10 Å.
Suspensions for SANS measurements were prepared in D2O to enhance the scattering length density differences between the particles and the solvent.
Al137+ clusters were synthesized in D2O; then, the Al12(AlO4)(OD)24(D2O)127+ species have scattering length densities similar to the scattering length density of D2O. Samples were introduced into 2 mm thick quartz cells for analysis.
TEM images were recorded using a Philips CM200 ‘Cryo’ microscope operated at 80 kV.
Cryo-TEM samples were prepared by quench-freezing a thin film of the colloidal suspension into liquid ethane cooled to −171 °C.
The specimen was mounted onto a Gatan 626 cryo-holder and transferred into the microscope.
The colloids were observed at low temperature (−180 °C) embedded in a thin layer of vitreous ice.
Before studying the aggregates formed from polymers and multivalent ions, the characteristics of polymers in water were examined.
This study was necessary in order to investigate the polymer conformations in the absence of multivalent metal ions.
It is well known that hydrogen bonds can form between acrylamide and acrylic acid functions leading to chain aggregation.
SANS measurements were, then, run on polymers in solution in the absence of metal ions and polymer solubility was investigated at pH 5.5.
Fig. 1 shows SANS curves for a series of PAA-b-PHEA polymers, whose molecular weights of the two blocks are indicated in the figure.
The scattered intensities are plotted as a function of the amplitude of the scattering vector, q.
The polymer weight concentrations of the samples vary between 17% and 20%, but the scattered intensities reported on Fig. 1 were normalized at the same polymer weight concentration.
The slopes at high q values are close to 1.7, which is characteristic of polymers in a good solvent, with excluded volume effects.
In that high q domain, all scattering curves, normalized at the same polymer concentration, superimpose, suggesting that all polymers have the same solubility in water.
The radii of gyration were determined by Guinier approximation I(q) = I(0)exp(−q2R2G/3) for PAA-b-PHEA polymers presented in Fig. 1.
It was observed that they do not depend on the polymer weight concentration.
A power law relation was obtained between the radii of gyration and the total polymer molecular weights: RG ∝ Mw0.62, as shown in Fig. 2.
The value of the power exponent corresponds to what is expected for water-soluble macromolecules with excluded volume effects.
The present results exclude any assembly phenomenon between polymers due to hydrogen bonding between block units.
Characterization of the polymers confirm that the DHBCs behave as soluble polymers and do not self-assemble.
The suspensions obtained by mixing of block copolymers and multivalent cations are characterized by the metal complexation degree R, which is the number of acrylate functions added per metal atom (R = [AA]/[M]).
Complexation of metal cations by acrylate groups leads to the spontaneous formation of objects larger than the initial polymer coil sizes.
Hydrodynamic diameters, Dh, of the aggregates were measured by dynamic light scattering.
As indicated in Table 2 with a series of PAA-b-PHEA copolymers, the hydrodynamic diameters of aggregates increase with the total molecular weight.
Typically, the size of the aggregate formed from Al137+ and PAA 1900-b-PHEA 8200, R = 1, (see Table 2) equals Dh = 41 nm, which is almost 4 times bigger than the hydrodynamic diameter of the corresponding copolymer in solution (11 nm).
The aggregate size does not considerably change with the acrylate to metal molar ratio, R, in the range of R values varying from 0.1 to 5.
This result suggests cooperative aggregation of the polymers.
SANS experiments were run to characterize the nanostructure of the induced assemblies.
Fig. 3 shows the scattering curve of an aggregate from Al137+ and PAA 1900-b-PHEA 8200 (R = 1), together with the scattering curve of the same copolymer in water.
The scattered intensities of the samples are plotted at the same copolymer concentration, in the absence and in the presence of polycations.
As Al137+ clusters were synthesized in D2O solvent, the Al12(AlO4)(OD)24(D2O)127+ species have a scattering length density (6.6 × 10−10 cm−2) that practically matches that of D2O (6.38 × 10−10 cm−2).
Then, the scattered intensity of the cation/polymer mixture essentially arises from the polymer blocks.
The comparison of the two curves in Fig. 3 clearly evidences the formation of polymer aggregates upon addition of multivalent ions.
At low q values, the observation of a scattered intensity higher for the suspension with polycations than that of the polymer solution supports the formation of polymer nanoassemblies.
The radii of gyration RG of the copolymer on one hand, and of the aggregate, on the other hand, were determined.
In the case described in Fig. 3, RG equals 11 nm for assemblies of PAA 1900-b-PHEA 8200 with Al137+ (R = 1), this can be compared to the radius of gyration of the copolymer in solution, which equals 2.5 nm, as determined by the Guinier approximation.
Table 2 gives the radii of gyration of aggregates formed from Al137+ and different PAA-b-PHEA polymers.
When increasing the copolymer length, the radius of gyration of the resulting aggregates increases.
From the ratio between the intensity at the Guinier plateau (IG) scattered by the aggregate and the intensity IG scattered by the polymer (the two curves being normalized at the same polymer concentration), it was possible to estimate the aggregation number Nagg of the assemblies (number of copolymers forming one micellar aggregate).
In the case described in Fig. 3 (PAA 1900-b-PHEA 8200 and Al137+, R = 1), Nagg equals 9.
The high q-range of the scattering curve (Fig. 3) characterizes the interface between the micelle and the solvent.
In that q-domain, a power law behaviour of the intensity, I(q) ∝ q−1.7, shows that the interface between the micelle and the solvent is constituted of a diffuse corona of polymeric chains in a good solvent.
The power exponent of 1.7 is in good agreement with an excluded volume model considering self-avoidance and mutual avoidance of the corona chains.
In this high q value domain, the scattered intensity from the aggregate is smaller than the intensity scattered by the polymer solution without multivalent ions.
Observation of a decrease in surface area of the suspension is consistent with the formation of nanoaggregates.
The similarity in the slopes of I(q) at high q values of the curves of the copolymer and of the aggregate is consistent with the small value of the aggregation number: the chains in the corona are not stretched, they are not more elongated than they are when the copolymer is in solution.
An interesting point is that the scattering curve of the aggregate presents a sharp decrease of the intensity (I(q) ∝ q−3.9) in the intermediate q-range (0.025 Å−1 < q < 0.045 Å−1).
This suggests that the core, which is formed from cations and the collapsed polyelectrolyte blocks, is well-defined and presents a rather sharp interface with the surrounding corona.
The aggregate scattering curve was simulated (Fig. 3) using Pedersen's model7,8 that was developed for form factors of core–corona micelles of block copolymers.
This model considers that the scattering object is constituted of a sphere of homogeneous density, surrounded by gaussian chains attached to it.
The gaussian chains are generated as random walks in three dimensions starting at the surface of the sphere.
The simulation of the experimental data is presented on Fig. 3, it shows that the model allows the structure of the present hybrid aggregate to be correctly described.
Nevertheless, because of the use of gaussian statistics for the corona chains in the model, a slight difference in slopes is observed at high q values.
The model gives a q−2 dependence of the intensity, whereas the experimental curves present smaller exponents (I(q) ∼ q−1.7).
This leads to a slight discrepancy, which is observed at higher q values, and that is due to the fact that excluded volume interactions between the chains were neglected.
Also, from the simulated curve, we can conclude that the aggregate core must be isotropic but we cannot affirm that it is spherical.
SANS data showed that the nanoaggregates are constituted of homogeneous small cores surrounded by a corona of chains in a good solvent.
The small values of RG/Rh (close to 0.5 for aggregates of Al137+ with PAA 1900-b-PHEA 8200 and PAA 2800-b-PHEA 11 100) support the core–corona architecture of the aggregates.
Fig. 4 shows a cryo-TEM image of micelles formed from Al137+ and PAA 2800-b-PHEA 11 100.
The image evidences a controlled microphase separation with well separated isotropic objects.
The particles observed by TEM present a small size distribution around a mean diameter of 9 nm; in the case of the system Al137+ and PAA 1900-b-PHEA 8200 (TEM image not shown here), the mean size equals about 7 nm (as reported in Table 2).
TEM images reveal that inorganic ions are segregated in small domains in the central part of the aggregates.
The different characterization results lead to the following description: the nanoassemblies are constituted of a central core formed from the insoluble metal polyacrylate complex and a corona of water-soluble neutral polymeric segments; the interface between the inorganic-rich core and the corona is rather sharp and well-defined.
A schematic representation of the hybrid micellar aggregates is then given in Fig. 5.
The stability of the colloids was investigated.
It was observed that the colloidal complexes are very stable with time (for months).
The neutral polymer segments constitute an effective barrier against particle aggregation.
Suspension stability does not suffer from a change in concentration, neither an increase in electrolyte concentration.
The concentration of monovalent ions (KCl, NaNO3) in the suspensions could be increased up to 2.8 M while the colloids remain stable and keep the same size.
The formation of coordination bonds between metal ions and acrylate groups within the core makes the aggregate stable towards salt addition.
Several asymmetric anionic–neutral block copolymers and different multivalent ions (Ca2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Al3+, La3+…, and polycations) were used to prepare nanoassemblies.
The neutral block could be polyacrylamide or polyhydroxyethylacrylate.
When the ratio between the molecular weight of the neutral block relative to that of the polyacrylate block is higher than 3, the aggregates present similar structural characteristics.
The microstructure described here is similar to that of core–corona micelles formed from amphiphilic block copolymers in a selective solvent.9,10
In the present case, the formation of core–corona structures is explained by the formation of an insoluble complex, whose macroscopic precipitation is inhibited by the presence of long neutral blocks.
It is well known that in the presence of multivalent ions, oppositely charged homopolymers precipitate into compact structures.11
In the case of DHBCs, macroscopic phase separation is prevented; neutral blocks sterically stabilize the water-incompatible phase giving rise to the formation of micellar-like structures.
The formation of supramolecular structures of DHBC was reported in literature in the case of formation of polyion complex (PIC) micelles from charged diblock copolymers with oppositely-charged polymers or surfactants.12,13,14,15
The formation of aggregates between DHBC and metal ions was also reported by several authors.16,17
The hybrid analogues of the PIC micelles, which are described here, present a major stability difference with PIC aggregates.
In the case of polymer PIC micelles, the complex formation is essentially triggered by electrostatic interaction and entropy gain for the released counter-ions of the polymers.
In the case of metal cations, the formation of coordination bonds is an additional factor of stability; inorganic/polymeric micelles are then very stable towards salt addition, in contrast to polymer–polymer or polymer–surfactant micelles.
In conclusion, the present results lead us to consider the complex system [hydrophilic diblock copolymer + multivalent ion] as an amphiphilic entity giving rise to stable hybrid micellar nanoaggregates.
As it was shown earlier, the hybrid micelles represent new supramolecular precursors for inorganic polycondensation reactions; they can lead to the formation of highly stable suspensions of nanoparticles.
Metal hydroxide particles were prepared using metal cations and hydrophilic complexing copolymers but the present hybrid micelles are also excellent candidates for the preparation of colloids of inorganic salts such as calcium carbonates, calcium phosphates or barium sulfate… It should also be mentioned that the present hybrid micelles can serve as model systems for reactions in confined environments.
Ionization-induced switch in aromatic molecule–nonpolar ligand recognition: Acidity of 1-naphthol+ (1-Np+) rotamers probed by IR spectra of 1-Np+–Ln complexes (L = Ar/N2, n ≤ 5)
The interaction of the trans (t) and cis (c) rotamers of the 1-naphthol cation (1-C10H8O+ = 1-Np+ = 1-hydroxynaphthalene+) with nonpolar ligands in the ground electronic state is characterized by IR photodissociation spectra of isolated 1-Np+–Ln complexes (L = Ar/N2) and density functional calculations at the UB3LYP/6-311G(2df,2pd) level.
Size-dependent frequency shifts of the O–H stretch vibration (Δν1) and photofragmentation branching ratios provide information about the stepwise microsolvation of both 1-Np+ rotamers in a nonpolar hydrophobic environment, including the formation of structural isomers, the competition between H-bonding and π-bonding, the estimation of ligand binding energies, and the acidity of t/c-1-Np+. t-1-Np+ is predicted to be more stable than c-1-Np+ by 9 kJ mol−1, with an isomerization barrier of 38 kJ mol−1.
The OH group in t-1-Np+ is slightly more acidic than in c-1-Np+ leading to stronger intermolecular H-bonds.
Both 1-Np+ rotamers are considerably less acidic than the phenol cation because of enhanced charge delocalization.
The 1-Np+−Ar spectrum displays ν1 bands of the more stable H-bound and the less stable π-bound t-1-Np+–Ar isomers.
Only the more stable H-bound dimers are identified for t/c-1-Np+–L2.
Analysis of the Δν1 shifts of the H-bound dimers yields a first experimental estimate for the proton affinity of the t-1-naphthoxy radical (∼908 ± 30 kJ mol−1).
The Δν1 shifts of 1-Np+–Ln (n ≤ 2 for Ar, n ≤ 5 for N2) suggest that the preferred microsolvation path begins with the formation of H-bound 1-Np+–L, which is further solvated by (n−1) π-bound ligands.
Ionization of 1-Np−Ln drastically changes the topology of the intermolecular interaction potential and thus the preferred aromatic substrate–nonpolar ligand recognition pattern.
Hydroxyarenes are fundamental molecules in chemistry, biology, and life sciences, and display a variety of interesting properties arising from both the hydroxy group and the aromatic π-electron system.1,2
In particular, they are strong photoacids, that is the acidity of the OH group increases drastically upon electronic excitation and ionization, which eventually may promote proton transfer to a suitable solvent.2–4
The properties of such proton transfer processes, which are among the most fundamental reactions occurring in chemical and biological systems, depend sensitively on the environment.
Consequently, (micro)solvated hydroxyarenes have become popular model systems to investigate energetics and dynamics of photo-induced proton transfer in both isolated complexes and in solution under controlled solvation conditions.2–20
The present work reports quantum chemical calculations and infrared (IR) spectra of 1-naphthol cations (1-Np+ = 1-C10H8O+ = 1-hydroxynaphthalene+) solvated by a well-defined number of nonpolar ligands (L = Ar/N2), providing direct access to the acidity of the OH group in the cation ground state and its dependence on stepwise solvation in a hydrophobic environment.
Significantly, aromatic molecules (A) with acidic functional YHk groups (e.g., Y = N, O) offer two major recognition sites for inert ligands L. L can bind to the aromatic π-electron system (π-bond) or to one of the k acidic protons of YHk (H-bond).
Alternative binding sites, such as H-bonds to aliphatic or aromatic CH protons, are usually less stable.
The preferred binding site in A–L dimers depends on several factors, including the degree of electronic excitation and charge state of A, the acidity of the YHk group, and the ligand type (polar or nonpolar).
For example, complexes of neutral A with rare gas atoms have π-bound equilibrium structures in the singlet electronic ground state (S0).
Examples include Ar complexes of benzene (Bz–Ar),21 phenol (Ph–Ar, YHk = OH),22,23 aniline (An–Ar, YHk = NH2),24 and indole (In–Ar, YHk = NH).25
The major contributions to the A–Ar attraction are dispersion forces between Ar and the π-electron system of A, which favor π-bonding.
In fact, H-bound isomers have not been detected for any aromatic A–Ar complex in S0.
The situation changes for A–N2 dimers, because the quadrupole moment of N2 leads to additional electrostatic interactions with the polar YHk group of A, so that the H-bond may energetically compete with the π-bond.
For example, N2 favors H-bonding to Ph22,26 but π-bonding to less acidic An27 as well as Bz.28,29
In general, the topology of the interaction potential of A+–L radical cation dimers differs qualitatively from that of neutral A–L, because of the significant additional electrostatic and inductive attraction arising from the positive charge.8,13,15,30,31
As a consequence, neutral and ionic A(+)–L dimers often possess rather different equilibrium structures and interaction energies.
For example, Ph+–Ar,32–35 An+–Ar,36 and In+–Ar37 have H-bound global minima in the ground electronic state of the cation (D0), whereas the π-bound isomers are only local minima.
Similarly, Ph+–N2,22,32,33,38 An+–N2,39 and In+–N237 prefer H-bonds over π-bonds in D0.
Because of the additional charge–quadrupole interaction, the H/π-bonds in A+–N2 are stronger than in A+–Ar.
Similar to A+–Ar/N2, the Ar and N2 dimers of protonated aromatic molecules (AH+) with acidic YHk groups (e.g., PhH+–Ar/N2)40–42 also favor H-bonds over π-bonds.
In contrast, the most stable A(H)+–Ar/N2 dimers of A(H)+ ions without YHk groups, such as Bz(H)+–Ar/N2,21,43–45 feature π-bonds, because CH protons are only weakly acidic even in the cation ground state.44
The ionization-induced switch in the preferred ligand binding site in A(+)–L imposes important consequences for spectroscopic studies of A+–L prepared by photoionization of A–L.
Often, A+–L is generated by resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) of A–L formed in a supersonic expansion.
Spectroscopic information of A+–L may then be extracted, for example, from photoionization efficiency spectra (PIE),46 mass analyzed threshold ionization (MATI),21,47 zero kinetic energy photoelectron (ZEKE) spectra,13 or IR photodissociation.8,10
However, all these ionization techniques suffer from the Franck–Condon principle, which prevents significant population of the most stable A+–L isomer for dimers with significantly different neutral and ionic global minimum structures.
This situation is, however, quite common for A(+)–L dimers with both polar and nonpolar L.31,32,48,49
To avoid the limitations of REMPI cluster ion generation, in the present work cold A+–Ln complexes are produced in a supersonic plasma expansion created by electron ionization (EI) of a molecular beam.50
This EI ion source generates A+–Ln complexes via EI of A followed by cluster aggregation.
Consequently, the EI source produces predominantly the most stable isomer of a given A+–Ln complex, independent of the most stable structure of neutral A–Ln.
This is in contrast to the REMPI ion source, which often generates only local minima of A+–Ln.
For example, EI-IR spectra of Ph+–Arn,32–35 An+–Arn,36 and In+–Arn37 were interpreted with global minimum structures, which completely escaped detection in the corresponding REMPI-IR and other photoionization spectra (PIE, ZEKE, MATI).
1-Np is one out of the two possible bicyclic monohydroxyarenes (1/2-Np).
It has two planar isomers, which differ by the orientation of the OH group with respect to the aromatic ring (Figs. 1 and 2), namely the trans (anti) and cis (syn) rotamers denoted t-1-Np and c-1-Np, respectively.
Spectroscopic information about the structures and relative energies of both rotamers is available from a variety of techniques, including (dispersed) laser-induced fluorescence,20,51,52 REMPI,19,53 and IR spectra.12,19
Information on the corresponding t/c-1-Np+ cation rotamers is provided by ZEKE,53 MATI,16 and REMPI-IR spectra.19
The results for t/c-1-Np(+) relevant for the present work can be summarized as follows.
In S0, t-1-Np is slightly more stable than c-1-Np (ΔE = 220 ± 50 cm−1)51 and its OH group is somewhat more acidic as demonstrated by the smaller O–H stretch frequency (ν1/cm−1 = 3655 vs. 3663).12
Interestingly, the energy order of both rotamers is reversed in S1 (ΔE = −59 cm−1).53
In D0, t-1-Np+ is again more stable than c-1-Np+ (ΔE = 495 cm−1), indicating that the potential for OH rotation is quite sensitive to both electronic excitation and ionization.53
The acidity of t-1-Np(+) is substantially increased upon ionization, as revealed by the large decrease in ν1 from 3655 to 3579 cm−1.19
No spectroscopic information is available for the acidity of c-1-Np+.
Spectroscopic and theoretical information about neutral and ionic 1-Np(+)–Ln complexes with L = Ar/N2 is rather limited.
REMPI,19,54 hole-burning,54 and IR spectra19 of t-1-Np–Ar are consistent with a π-bound structure in S0, in agreement with quantum chemical calculations.54
Similarly, the REMPI-IR spectrum of t-1-Np+–Ar in the O–H stretch range was interpreted with a π-bound isomer in D0.19
No evidence for an H-bound 1-Np(+)–Ar isomer has been reported for both S0 and D0.
Calculations predict π-bound t-1-Np–N2 to be more stable than the H-bound isomer in S0, and preliminary REMPI and hole-burning spectra appear to be consistent with this view.54
To the best of our knowledge, no spectroscopic information is available for any c-1-Np(+)–Ln complex in both S0 and D0.9,16,19,20
Such information is difficult to obtain because of the usually low population of the less stable c-1-Np rotamer in molecular beams and steric hindrance involved in the formation of H-bound c-1-Np(+)–L complexes.
Several aspects motivated the present EI-IR spectroscopic and theoretical study on size-selected 1-Np+–Ln complexes with L = Ar and N2.
(1) These clusters serve as a suitable model for solvation of the highly acidic 1-Np+ cations in a nonpolar solvent.
Particularly interesting is the competition between H-bonding and π-bonding and its consequences on the cluster growth.
As Ar and N2 are weak proton acceptors, proton transfer from 1-Np+ to the solvent may not be expected in D0 even for complete solvation.55
(2) As the ability of the OH group to form H-bonds to a ligand is correlated with its acidity, the EI-IR spectra of H-bound 1-Np+–L dimers directly probe the acidity of both 1-Np+ rotamers and eventually enable a first estimate of the unknown proton affinity of the 1-naphthoxy radical.
The detection of c-1-Np+–(N2)n in the present work corresponds to the first observation of c-1-Np+ complexes and enables thus direct comparison of both 1-Np+ rotamers.
H-bound 1-Np+–L isomers are also characterized by density functional calculations, because theoretical studies of the interaction potential in these dimers are not available.
(3) Comparison of 1-Np+–Ln with Ph+–Ln22,32–35 and H2O+–Ln56–59 reveals the influence of substitution of a mono- and bicyclic aromatic ring on the acidity of ROH+ cations.
The acidity is expected to decrease in the order H2O+ > Ph+ > 1-Np+ because of increasing charge delocalization in the aromatic ring19.
EI-IR photodissociation spectra of mass-selected 1-Np+–Ln complexes (L = Ar/N2, n ≤ 5) were recorded in a tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS1/2) coupled to an EI ion source and an octopole ion trap.50
Briefly, 1-Np+–Ln were generated in a plasma expansion created by EI of a pulsed supersonic molecular beam.
The expansion gas was produced by seeding 1-Np vapor (T ≈ 350 K) in Ar or N2 at stagnation pressures of 3–10 bar.
As described previously,33 the dominant production mechanism of 1-Np+–Ln starts with EI of 1-Np near the nozzle orifice, which is followed by three-body association in the high-pressure region of the expansion:1-Np + e → 1-Np+ + 2e1-Np+–Ln−1 + L + M → 1-Np+–Ln + M (M = L, 1-Np)This reaction sequence produces mainly the most stable 1-Np+–Ln complexes and to smaller extent less stable isomers.33–37,60,61
Alternative mechanisms involving the formation of neutral 1-Np–Ln complexes and subsequent EI play only a minor role.33
Fig. 3 shows a mass spectrum of the ion source recorded after optimization for 1-Np+–(N2)n generation.
The spectrum is dominated by Nn+ and [X–(N2)n]+ cluster ions, including X = 1-Np and the impurity H2O. The intensity ratios of 1-Np+–(N2)n are of the order of 80∶8∶2∶1 for n = 0–3, indicating the formation of weakly-bound noncovalent complexes.
The central part of the plasma expansion was extracted through a skimmer into QMS1, which was tuned to the mass of 1-Np+–Ln.
The mass-selected 1-Np+–Ln beam was then injected into an octopole ion guide, where it interacted with a tunable IR laser pulse.
Resonant vibrational excitation of 1-Np+–Ln induced the evaporation of one or more ligands: 1-Np+–Ln + hν → [1-Np+–Ln]* → 1-Np+–Lm + (n − m)L Other photodissociation channels were not observed.
1-Np+–Lm fragments generated in the octopole were mass-selected by QMS2 and monitored as a function of the laser frequency (ν) to obtain the EI-IR spectra of 1-Np+–Ln.
Several fragment channels (m) were observed for 1-Np+–(N2)n parent complexes with n > 3.
Consequently, IR spectra were recorded simultaneously in the two dominant fragment channels.
As an example, Fig. 4 shows the mass spectrum obtained for resonant ν1 excitation of t-1-Np+–(N2)4.
Major fragment channels are m = 0 and m = 1 arising from laser-induced dissociation and m = 3 produced by metastable decay in the octopole.
To separate laser-induced fragmentation from interfering metastable decay, the ion source was triggered at twice the laser repetition rate and signals from alternating triggers (laser on, laser off) were subtracted.
As the IR spectra recorded in different fragment channels are similar, only the spectra obtained in the dominant channels are shown.
IR radiation was generated by a single-mode optical parametric oscillator laser system and calibrated to an accuracy of better than 1 cm−1 by analyzing atmospheric water absorptions along the IR laser path62.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out for t/c-1-Np+ and their H-bound dimers at the UB3LYP/6-311G(2df,2pd) and UB3LYP/6-31G* levels of theory63 to characterize the intermolecular H-bonds and their effects on the t/c-1-Np+ properties.
As the results are qualitatively similar for both basis sets, only those obtained with the larger basis are reported.
The t/c-1-Np+(–L) properties relevant for the present work are summarized in Table 1 and Figs. 1 and 2.
For comparison, additional calculations were carried out for t/c-1-Np, Ph(+), and Ph+–L at the same theoretical level.
Table 1 includes structural and energetic attributes of the intermolecular H–L bond, such as length (RH–L), angle (θO–H–L), dissociation energy (De), and intermolecular stretch frequency (νs), as well as relevant properties of the intramolecular O–H bond, namely length (RO–H), stretch frequency (ν1), and IR intensity (I1).
In general, all coordinates were relaxed during the search for stationary points.
Intermolecular interaction energies were counter-poise corrected for basis set superposition error.64
Harmonic vibrational frequencies were scaled by a factor of 0.9516 to bring the calculated ν1 frequencies of both t-1-Np+ and Ph+ into agreement with the experimental values, ν1 = 3579 and 3534 cm−1.19,65
First, the bare t/c-1-Np(+) rotamers are considered.
Geometry optimization results in planar equilibrium structures of 1-Np in both S0 and D0, consistent with available spectroscopic data.52,53
Fig. 2 compares the potentials for internal OH rotation in 1-Np and Ph calculated for S0 and D0 including zero-point energy contributions.
In S0, t-1-Np is predicted to be more stable than c-1-Np by ΔE = 360 cm−1, in reasonable agreement with the value of ΔE = 220 ± 50 cm−1 estimated from the analysis of the UV spectrum recorded in an absorption cell.51
The barrier for internal rotation from t-1-Np toward c-1-Np, Vb = 1087 cm−1, is somewhat smaller than in Ph, Vb = 1151 cm−1.
The latter value is close to the experimental barrier determined from rotationally resolved UV spectroscopy in a molecular beam, Vb = 1215 ± 10 cm−1,66 suggesting that the employed theoretical level is of sufficient accuracy to yield reliable internal rotation potentials.
In D0, t-1-Np+ is also calculated to be more stable than c-1-Np+ and the energy difference, ΔE = 746 cm−1, is approximately twice that in S0.
The difference in stability of both rotamers in D0 and S0 corresponds to the difference in their adiabatic ionization potentials, and the predicted value is compatible with the experimental measurement, 386 vs. 281 cm−1.53
The barrier for OH rotation from t-1-Np+ toward c-1-Np+, Vb = 3198 cm−1, is significantly larger than in S0.
The corresponding barrier for Ph+ is even higher, Vb = 4514 cm−1.
The barrier height of hydroxyarenes is usually correlated with their C–O bond strength.52,66
In general, the stronger and shorter the C–O bond, the more hindered the internal rotation.
Specifically, RC–O/Å∼1.363 > 1.318 > 1.307 and Vb/cm−1 = 1087 < 3198 < 4514 for 1-Np, 1-Np+, and Ph+.
Apparently, electron donation from the OH group into the aromatic π-electron system is more efficient in D0 than in S0 and larger for Ph+ as compared to 1-Np+.
In contrast to the C–O bond, the O–H bond strength decreases along the series c-1-Np+ > t-1-Np+ > Ph+, as is signaled by the increasing bond length (RO–H/Å = 0.9666 < 0.9675 < 0.9714) and the decreasing stretch frequency (ν1/cm−1 = 3587 > 3579 > 3534).
The rise in the acidity of the OH group along this series is also mirrored by the increasing positive partial charge on the OH proton.44
In general, the differences between the t/c-1-Np+ rotamers are significantly smaller than between t/c-1-Np+ and Ph+.
Interestingly, the IR oscillator strengths for ν1 of c-1-Np+ and t-1-Np+ differ by a factor of 2.4 (I1/km mol−1 = 121 vs. 289).
The H-bound 1-Np+–L dimers feature trans-linear proton bonds of L to the acidic OH group of 1-Np+, leading to planar equilibrium geometries with Cs symmetry (Fig. 1).
Because of steric hindrance arising from the interaction with the proton on the second aromatic ring (C(8)H), the deviation from linearity is much larger for c-1-Np+–L (∼150°) as compared to t-1-Np+–L (∼170°).
The C(8)H–N and C(8)H–Ar separations of 2.71 and 3.07 Å in c-1-Np+–L are close to the values expected from van der Waals radii (RvdW/Å = 1.1, 1.5, 1.9 for H, N, Ar).67
The anisotropy of the long-range charge–quadrupole and charge–induced dipole interactions aligns the N2 ligand in such a way that the molecular axis points toward the positive charge,30,32,37,39,41,44,60,68–71 resulting in nearly linear H⋯N–N configurations in t/c-1-Np+–N2 (θH–N–N = 175/171°).
The increase in the acidity along the series c-1-Np+< t-1-Np+< Ph+ is directly correlated with the intermolecular interaction strength, leading to shorter H–L bonds (RH–L/Å = 2.59 > 2.46 > 2.35 for L = Ar and 2.11 > 2.02 > 1.95 for L = N2) with larger stretch frequencies (νs/cm−1 = 46 < 49 < 73 for L = Ar and 88 < 94 < 117 for L = N2) and higher dissociation energies (De/cm−1 = 287 < 372 < 685 for L = Ar and 1205 < 1336 < 1731 for L = N2).
The effects of H-bonding on the intramolecular O–H bonds are an elongation (ΔRO–H), a reduction in the stretch frequency (Δν1), and an enhancement in the IR oscillator strength (ΔI1).
Again, the magnitude of these effects is correlated with the H-bond strength and increases along the series c-1-Np+< t-1-Np+< Ph+: ΔRO–H/Å = 0.0016 < 0.0027 < 0.0044 for L = Ar and 0.0048 < 0.0068 < 0.0099 for L = N2; −Δν1/cm−1 = 34 < 57 < 92 for L = Ar and 91 < 134 < 195 for L = N2; ΔI1/km mol−1 = 182 < 445 < 537 for L = Ar and 453 < 977 < 1060 for L = N2.
These theoretical results demonstrate that IR spectroscopy in the O–H stretch range is a suitable tool to probe both the acidity of the t/c-1-Np+ rotamers and their ability to form H-bonds.
Similar to previous studies on (para-halogenated) Ph(H)+–Arn and Ph(H)+–(N2)n,32–35,40–42 the EI-IR spectra of the corresponding 1-Np+–Arn and 1-Np+–(N2)n complexes clearly demonstrate that the H-bonds are more stable than the π-bonds.
Hence, the energetically most favorable 1-Np+–Ln cluster growth begins with the formation of a H-bound 1-Np+–L dimer, to which further π-bound ligands are attached.
The exact position of the π-bound ligands is however not obvious (e.g., over the first or the second aromatic ring) and difficult to determine from both the present spectroscopic and theoretical approaches.
As DFT calculations do not properly describe dispersion forces, π-bound 1-Np+–L isomers were not investigated theoretically.32
On the other hand, previous studies revealed that π-bound ligands have only very minor effects on the O–H bond properties19,32,35.
The EI-IR spectra of 1-Np+–Arn (n ≤ 2) and 1-Np+–(N2)n (n ≤ 5) recorded in the O–H stretch range are shown in Figs. 5 and 6.
Table 2 summarizes the band maxima and widths of the ν1 transitions observed (A–C), along with their isomer assignments.
Fig. 5 compares EI-IR spectra of 1-Np+–N2 (a, b) and 1-Np+–Ar (c) with the REMPI-IR spectrum of t-1-Np+–Ar (d).19
The EI-IR spectrum of 1-Np+–Ar displays two transitions, which are attributed to the ν1 fundamentals of the H-bound (A) and π-bound (B) isomers of t-1-Np+–Ar, respectively.
These assignments are based on the band positions, relative IR intensities, and band profiles, as well as the comparison with the DFT calculations and the REMPI-IR spectrum.
The more intense band at 3538 cm−1 (A) is assigned to ν1 of H-bound t-1-Np+–Ar (Fig. 1b).
The derived complexation-induced red shift of −41 cm−1 from the corresponding t-1-Np+ transition (3579 cm−1)19 is consistent with the calculated value (−57 cm−1).
The blue-shaded band contour with a sharp P-branch head is characteristic for excitation of a proton donor stretch vibration, because the intermolecular H-bond becomes stronger and shorter in the excited state, resulting in larger rotational constants.30,32,61,70
Band B at 3580 cm−1 is assigned to ν1 of π-bound t-1-Np+–Ar, in good agreement with the REMPI-IR spectrum (Fig. 5d).19
The modest complexation-induced blue shift of +1 cm−1 and the rather symmetric band profile support this assignment, because intermolecular π-bonding has almost no influence on the O–H bond.
There are actually other binding sites, which also have little impact on the O–H bond, such as H-bonding to aromatic C–H bonds.
Although at present these alternative binding sites cannot be completely ruled out from both the experimental and the theoretical point of view, the presently favored assignment for B is to a π-bound isomer and this interpretation is used as working hypothesis for further discussion in this paper.
This scenario is supported by theoretical and spectroscopic data obtained for BzH+–Ar,44,45 Bz+–Ar,43,72–74 and PhH+–Ar,42 which indicate that intermolecular CH–Ar bonds in A(H)+–Ar are less stable than π-bonds.
The EI-IR spectrum of t-1-Np+–Ar clearly demonstrates that the H-bound isomer is the global minimum on the intermolecular potential, whereas the π-bound structure is a less stable local minimum.
Nonetheless, the H-bound isomer could not be detected in the REMPI-IR spectrum (Fig. 5d),19 because it was obtained through resonant ionization of π-bound t-1-Np–Ar.
In contrast to both t-1-Np+–Ar isomers, spectroscopic indication of the corresponding c-1-Np+–Ar dimers in the EI-IR spectra is only tentative.
The ν1 frequency of bare c-1-Np+ has not been measured,19 and the calculated value is slightly larger than for t-1-Np+ (+8 cm−1).
Some of the EI-IR spectra recorded for 1-Np+–Ar actually reveal a very weak band at 3595 cm−1 (indicated by an asterisk in Fig. 5c) appearing about 15 cm−1 to the blue of π-bound t-1-Np+–Ar.
At first glance, this signal may be attributed to ν1 of π-bound c-1-Np+–Ar, which could occur in detectable abundance only under certain experimental conditions.
If this interpretation were correct, a minor part of the blue wing of band A may arise from ν1 of H-bound c-1-Np+–Ar (Fig. 1d).
However, according to the analysis of the 1-Np+–N2 spectra (vide infra), the abundances of c-1-Np+ and its Ar complex are probably too small for observing ν1 of π-bound c-1-Np+–Ar even under favorable (e.g., warm) expansion conditions.
Thus, the interpretation of the weak 3595 cm−1 band remains open.
Fig. 5 compares EI-IR spectra of 1-Np+–N2 recorded under warm (a) and cold (b) expansion conditions, as revealed from the widths of the observed rotational band contours.
The cold spectrum (b) displays a single blue-shaded band at 3467 cm−1 (A), which is assigned to ν1 of H-bound t-1-Np+–N2 (Fig. 1a).
The measured red shift of −112 cm−1 upon H-bonding is slightly smaller than the calculated value of −134 cm−1.
Moreover, it is roughly three times larger than the one for t-1-Np+–Ar (−41 cm−1) because of the stronger H-bond.
In addition to band A, the warm 1-Np+–N2 spectrum (a) shows a transition at 3499 cm−1 (C), which is absent in the cold spectrum (b).
This band is attributed to ν1 of H-bound c-1-Np+–N2 (Fig. 1c).
The −88 cm−1 shift from calculated ν1 of c-1-Np+ (3587 cm−1) agrees with the prediction (−91 cm−1).
Both EI-IR spectra of 1-Np+–N2 do not show any absorption near 3580 cm−1, implying that the abundances of the π-bound t/c-1-Np+–N2 isomers were below the detection limit under both warm and cold conditions.
The ratios of the integrated ν1 band intensities observed in the EI-IR spectra of 1-Np+–L can be used to estimate the relative abundances of the H-bound and π-bound isomers in the plasma expansion, using the calculated ν1 IR oscillator strengths of t/c-1-Np+ and H-bound t/c-1-Np+–L (Table 1) and assuming that π-bound t/c-1-Np+–L have the same ν1 IR intensities as bare t/c-1-Np+.32,36,39
For t-1-Np+–Ar, this procedure results in an abundance ratio of NH∶Nπ≈1.6, on the basis of the experimental ν1 intensity ratio of ≈4 and the theoretical ratio IH∶Iπ ≈ 2.5.
For t-1-Np+–N2, a lower limit for NH∶Nπ > 9 can be estimated from the achieved signal-to-noise ratio (≈40) and IH∶Iπ ≈ 4.4.
The larger abundance of the H-bound t-1-Np+–L isomers suggests that they are more stable than the π-bound dimers, because the EI source produces predominantly the most stable isomer of a given complex.33,50
Moreover, the energy difference between both isomers appears to be significantly larger for t-1-Np+–N2 than for t-1-Np+–Ar, resulting in a less efficient production of the π-bound isomer for the N2 complex.
Similar to previous studies on Ph+–Ar and In+–Ar,34,37 the relative intensity ratio of the ν1 bands of H-bound and π-bound t-1-Np+–Ar depended on the expansion conditions, confirming that both transitions arise indeed from two different isomers.
The spectrum in Fig. 5c was obtained when the conditions were optimized for the production of π-bound t-1-Np+–Ar.
As the relative population of the H-bound isomer increased for decreasing effective source temperature, this isomer corresponds to the global minimum of the t-1-Np+–Ar potential, whereas the π-bound structure is a less stable local minimum.
The population ratio of the H-bound isomers of t-1-Np+–N2 and c-1-Np+–N2 in the warm spectrum of 1-Np+–N2 (Fig. 5a) is deduced as Nt∶Nc ≈ 8 from the experimental (≈18) and predicted (≈2.2) ν1 intensity ratios.
As the N2 complexation energies are similar for both 1-Np+ rotamers (1336 and 1205 cm−1), the c-1-Np+ concentration in the plasma expansion is estimated to be roughly one order smaller than that for t-1-Np+.
This result is consistent with the production mechanism described in section 2 and the internal rotation potentials in Fig. 2.
Assuming a nozzle temperature of T ≈ 350 K, the energy difference of c-1-Np and t-1-Np of ΔE ≈ 220 cm−1 corresponds to a thermal population ratio of Nt∶Nc ≈ 2..551
Adiabatic cooling in the supersonic expansion increases this ratio only slightly because both isomers are separated by a significant barrier (Vb = 1087 cm−1 corresponds to T ≈ 1560 K).75
For example, Nt∶Nc ≈ 8 was observed in a previous molecular beam experiment.20
Assuming similar cooling of the t/c-1-Np rotamers in our expansion and mainly vertical ionization of the EI process, eqn. (1a), a similar ratio is obtained for the ionic t/c-1-Np+ rotamers because isomerization is strongly hindered by a large barrier in D0 (Vb = 3198 cm−1).
Owing to comparable complexation energies for H-bonding and also π-bonding for both 1-Np+ rotamers, the t/c-1-Np+–L dimer population ratios should be similar to the t/c-1-Np+ monomer ratios, eqn. (1b), i.e.Nt∶Nc ≈ 3–10 depending on the efficiency of adiabatic cooling of neutral t/c-1-Np.
Thus, the deduced ratio of Nt∶Nc ≈ 8 for the H-bound t/c-1-Np+–N2 isomers is within the expected range.
If the weak 3595 cm−1 band in the 1-Np+–Ar spectrum were indeed due to ν1 of π-bound c-1-Np+–Ar, the relative abundance of π-bound t/c-1-Np+–Ar (and also t/c-1–Np+) would be derived as Nt∶Nc ≈ 2.1 from the experimental (≈5) and predicted (≈2.4) ν1 intensity ratios.
This rather small ratio would imply an unexpectedly high population of both c-1-Np+ and π-bound c-1-Np+–Ar and makes this tentative assignment questionable.
Fig. 6 reproduces the EI-IR spectra of 1-Np+–Arn (n ≤ 2) and 1-Np+–(N2)n (n ≤ 5) recorded in the dominant fragment channels (Table 3).
The 1-Np+–Ar spectrum (a) is dominated by two transitions at 3538 (A) and 3580 (B) cm−1 assigned to ν1 of H-bound and π-bound t-1-Np+–Ar (section 4.1).
The 1-Np+–Ar2 spectrum (b) reveals only a single band at 3539 cm−1 (A), which is shifted by merely +1 cm−1 from band A of H-bound t-1-Np+–Ar.
Consequently, this band is assigned to ν1 of a t-1-Np+–Ar2 isomer, which is obtained by adding a π-bound ligand to H-bound t-1-Np+–Ar, denoted t-1-Np+–Ar2(H/π).
A blue shift of +1 cm−1 is also observed for attachment of a π-bound Ar ligand to bare t-1-Np+.
The ν1 transitions of t-1-Np+–Ar2 isomers with two π-bound ligands, t-1-Np+–Ar2(2π), are expected near 3580 cm−1 (B).
As the 1-Np+–Ar2 spectrum lacks any signal in that frequency range, the abundance of t-1-Np+–Ar2(2π) isomers is below the detection limit.
The abundance ratio of t-1-Np+–Ar2(2π) and t-1-Np+–Ar2(H/π) is estimated to be less than 5%.
This result confirms that the H-bond between Ar and t-1-Np+ is stronger than the π-bond.
Hence, the preferred solvation sequence in small t-1-Np+–Arn complexes begins with the formation of an H-bound t-1-Np+–Ar dimer core, which is further solvated by (n − 1) π-bound ligands.
The 1-Np+–N2 spectrum (Fig. 6c) displays two transitions at 3467 (A) and 3499 (C) cm−1 assigned to ν1 of the H-bound isomers of t-1-Np+–N2 and c-1-Np+–N2 (section 4.1).
Attachment of four further N2 ligands causes only small incremental blue shifts, suggesting that the observed t/c-1-Np+–(N2)n complexes have one H-bound and (n−1) π-bound ligands.
Fig. 7 visualizes the ν1 frequencies of the most stable isomers of t-1-Np+–Arn, t-1-Np+–(N2)n, and c-1-Np+–(N2)n as a function of the cluster size n.
Table 3 lists the photofragmentation branching ratios measured for resonant ν1 excitation of the H/(n − 1)π isomers of t-1-Np+–Arn and t-1-Np+–(N2)n.
In agreement with previous studies on related systems,33,37,39,42–44,50,57,60,61 the range of photo-induced fragment channels (m) for a given parent cluster size (n) is rather narrow (Fig. 4).
This information is used to roughly estimate ligand binding energies within the framework of a simple model, which assumes that the absorbed photon energy (ν1) is available for subsequent ligand evaporation.33
The ligands are classified in H-bound and π-bound ones with dissociation energies D0(H) > D0(π), and all π-bound ligands are assumed to have the same binding energy.
Larger t-1-Np+–(N2)n complexes evaporate on average about five π-bound ligands upon ν1 excitation (∼3500 cm−1), yielding an estimated dissociation energy of the order of D0(π) ∼ 650 ± 150 cm−1.
Using this information, the branching ratios observed for n = 4 and 5 lead to 500 < D0(H)/cm−1 < 2000, i.e.D0(H) ∼ 1250 ± 750 cm−1, which agrees with the predicted value, De(H) = 1336 cm−1.
Within the cluster size range investigated, the ν1 bands assigned to c-1-Np+–(N2)n display photofragmentation branchings similar to the ν1 bands of t-1-Np+–(N2)n, confirming that D0(π) and D0(H) are roughly comparable for both 1-Np+ rotamers.
The t-1-Np+–Ar2(H/π) trimer evaporates both ligands upon ν1 excitation, implying that D0(H) + D0(π) < 3540 cm−1.
The EI-IR spectra of 1-Np+–Arn are dominated by ν1 absorptions assigned to Ar complexes of the more abundant t-1-Np+ rotamer.
Moreover, the relative ν1 intensities of the H-bound and π-bound dimers suggest that the H-bond of Ar to t-1-Np+ is more stable than the π-bond, D0(H) > D0(π).
This conclusion is in line with the lack of detection of the 1-Np+–Ar2(2π) isomer.
The binding energies of the π-bound dimers of Bz+–Ar, para-difluorobenzene+–Ar, In+–Ar, and Ph+–Ar were accurately measured as 512 ± 3, 572 ± 6, 537 ± 10, and 535 ± 3 cm−1, respectively.15,23,76,77
As the strength of the π-bond of Ar to an aromatic cation A+ is apparently rather insensitive to the detailed structure of A+,44D0(π) of t/c-1-Np+–Ar may be estimated as ∼550 ± 50 cm−1.
(This is contrast to neutral A–Ar dimers, where D0(π) increases with the number of aromatic rings15.) The t-1-Np+–Ar2 photofragmentation data show that D0(H) + D0(π) < 3540 cm−1, yielding 500 < D0(H)/cm−1 < 3040.
The upper limit can be further reduced because D0(H) of t/c-1-Np+–Ar should be somewhat lower than D0(H) of Ph+–Ar (670 ± 140 cm−1).33
First, Δν1 of H-bound t-1-Np+–Ar is much smaller than Δν1 of H-bound Ph+–Ar (1.15 vs. 2.0%),33 because t-1-Np+ is less acidic than Ph+.
Second, the NH∶Nπ ratio of t-1-Np+–Ar in the EI source is lower than for Ph+–Ar under comparable conditions.
When the conditions are optimized for the generation of the π-bound isomers, NH∶Nπ ≈ 1.6 for t-1-Np+–Ar and ≈4 for Ph+–Ar.35
This comparison suggests that D0(H) − D0(π) is larger for Ph+–Ar than for t-1-Np+–Ar.
Because D0(π) of Ph+−Ar and t-1-Np+–Ar are comparable, D0(H) of Ph+–Ar provides an upper limit for D0(H) of t-1-Np+–Ar, resulting in 500 < D0(H)/cm−1 < 800 or D0(H) ≈ 650 ± 150 cm−1 for t-1-Np+–Ar.
Thus, the calculated dissociation energy of De = 372 cm−1 substantially underestimates the true interaction energy, in line with conclusions previously drawn for UB3LYP/6-311G(2df,2pd) calculations of related Ar complexes.32,35,36,41
Surprisingly, despite the underestimated interaction, this theoretical level slightly overestimates the Δν1 shifts.
In the limit of adiabatic separation of inter- and intramolecular degrees of freedom, the Δν1 shifts correspond to the changes in the intermolecular binding energies upon ν1 excitation.
The −41 cm−1 shift for H-bound t-1-Np+–Ar implies that the interaction increases by 5–8%, resulting in D0(H) ≈ 690 ± 150 cm−1 in the v1 = 1 state.
On the other hand, the +1 cm−1 shift for π-bound t-1-Np+–Ar means that ν1 excitation only slightly destabilizes the intermolecular π-bond (∼550 ± 50 cm−1) by less than 0.3%.
Available REMPI,19,54 hole-burning,54 and IR spectra19 of t-1-Np–Ar have been interpreted with a π-bound global minimum structure.
This view is supported by recent quantum chemical calculations at the ri-MP2/ccpVTZ level, which predict the π-bond to be more stable than the H-bond in S0.54
No experimental evidence for the less stable H-bound isomer has been reported so far.19,54
The π-bound isomer optimizes the dispersion forces between Ar and the π-electron system of the aromatic ring, which dominate the attractive part of the intermolecular potential in S0.
On the other hand, the EI-IR spectrum of t-1-Np+–Ar clearly shows that the H-bond is the preferred intermolecular recognition site in D0, because of the additional induction forces between the charge distribution in t-1-Np+ and the polarisability of Ar.
In particular, the large positive partial charge on the acidic O–H proton causes the substantial additional stabilization of the H-bond on ionization.44
The ionization-induced switch in the preferred recognition motif from π-bonding to H-bonding has now been demonstrated for several A–Ar and A–CH4 dimers involving aromatic molecules A with acidic functional YHk groups (Y = O, N) and appears to be a general phenomenon.
Investigated molecules include A = (para-halogenated) Ph,32–35 An,36 In,37 and 1-Np.
H-bonds to Ar are also the most stable binding pattern for protonated aromatic molecules (AH+) featuring acidic functional groups, such as PhH+ or 1-NpH+.40–42,78
Significantly, Ar and CH4 prefer intermolecular π-bonds over H-bonds to A(H)+ without acidic substituents, such as Bz(H)+.43–45
Aromatic and aliphatic C–H bonds in A(H)+ are only little acidic, so that dispersion forces (favoring π-bonds) override the induction forces (favoring H-bonds).
The drastic change in the intermolecular potential and particularly in the geometry of the most stable structure of 1-Np–Ar induced by ionization explains why the H-bound t-1-Np+–Ar isomer has completely escaped detection in the REMPI-IR spectrum of this cation dimer (Fig. 5d).19
In this experiment, t-1-Np+–Ar dimers were prepared by REMPI of π-bound t-1-Np–Ar via the intermediate S1 state.
Consequently, the Franck–Condon factors for populating the H-bound global minimum of t-1-Np+–Ar are nearly vanishing.
This example demonstrates the severe limitations of photoionization techniques for the characterization of the most stable isomers of cluster cations in cases where the cluster structure changes drastically upon ionization.
Such significant structural changes are, however, typical for ionization of a large variety of complexes and the rule rather than the exception.31,48,49
Similar to Ph(H)+–N2,32,33,41,42 An+–N2,39 and In+–N2,37 the H-bound t/c-Np+–N2 isomers correspond to the global minima on their intermolecular potentials.
The lack of absorptions of π-bound t/c-Np+–N2 in the EI-IR spectra demonstrates that these are substantially less stable local minima.32,39
Similarly, π-bound isomers were not observed in the EI-IR spectra of An+–N2 and Ph(H)+–N2.32,39,41
In contrast, π-bound In+–N2 could be weakly observed suggesting that π-bonding becomes competitive with H-bonding for A(H)+–N2 dimers with less acidic A(H)+.
In line with this trend, N2 complexes of A(H)+ without acidic functional groups, such as Bz(H)+, prefer π-bonds with N2 over H-bonds.43–45
The photofragmentation data of 1-Np+–(N2)n yield a binding energy of the order of D0(π) ∼ 650 cm−1 for both 1-Np+ rotamers.
This value is similar to the dissociation energies of other π-bound A(H)+–N2 complexes, such as Ph+–N2 (D0 = 750 ± 150 cm−1),33 An+–N2 (D0 = 700 ± 200 cm−1),39 BzH+–N2 (D0 ∼ 800 cm−1),44 and the carbenium isomers of PhH+–N2 (D0 = 750 ± 150 cm−1).42
Similar to the corresponding Ar complexes, the dissociation energies of π-bound A(H)+–N2 are relatively insensitive to the detailed structure of A(H)+.44
This is in contrast to the strength of the H-bonds in A(H)+–N2, which depends sensitively on the acidity of the proton donor group of A(H)+.
Photofragmentation data for 1-Np+–(N2)n yield D0(H) = 1250 ± 750 cm−1 for both 1-Np+ rotamers.
According to the ν1 band shifts and the calculations, t-1-Np+ is somewhat more acidic than c-1-Np+, resulting in slightly stronger H-bonds.
However, D0(H) of both t/c-1-Np+–N2 dimers should be significantly smaller than D0(H) of Ph+–N2, which was measured as 1640 ± 10 cm−1.38
The Δν1 shifts of −112 and −88 cm−1 correspond to the increases of the H-bond strengths in t-1-Np+–N2 and c-1-Np+–N2 upon ν1 excitation.
Presently, it is not established which type of intermolecular bond is favored by 1-Np-N2 in S0. ri-MP2/ccpVTZ calculations for t-1-Np–N2 predict the π-bond to be more stable than the H-bond.54
REMPI and hole-burning spectra suggest that only one isomer is produced in the supersonic expansion and that this isomer is probably π-bound.54
Interestingly, Ph–N2 prefers H-bonding,22,26,38 whereas N2 dimers of less acidic An and Bz have π-bound global minima in S0.27–29
Apparently, the most favorable recognition motif in neutral A–N2 dimers is determined by a subtle balance between dispersion, induction, and electrostatic forces, which is governed by the polarisability and permanent multipole moments of A as well as the acidity of the YHk group (if present).
In contrast, the EI-IR spectra of t/c-1-Np+–N2 as well as Ph(H)+–N2,32,33,41,42 An+–N2,39 and In+–N2,37 clearly show that H-bonding is the stronger interaction type for the cation.
This result suggests that this trend is quite common for A(H)+–N2 dimers involving acidic A(H)+ ions.
Similar to A(H)+–Ar, A(H)+–N2 without acidic groups, such as Bz(H)+–N2, feature intermolecular π-bonds in the cation ground state.43–45
On the other hand, when the number of aromatic π-electrons and thus the dispersion forces are reduced to a minimum, such as in cyclic C3H3+ with only two π-electrons, N2 actually prefers H-bonding to the aromatic CH protons over π-bonding.60,69,71
The optimal 1-Np+–L interaction is for any angular orientation significantly stronger than the L–L attraction, De ∼ 100 cm−1 for both Ar2 and (N2)279,80 Thus, the 1-Np+–Ln cluster growth is mainly driven by the 1-Np+–L dimer potential, because three-body forces are small for ion complexes with nonpolar ligands.
Consequently, the solvation sequence for the most stable 1-Np+–Ln complexes starts with the formation of H-bound 1-Np+–L, which is further solvated by (n − 1) π-bound ligands.
A similar cluster growth was deduced for Ph(H)+–Ln and An+–Ln with L = Ar and N2, which also starts with the solvation of the acidic protons of the OH(2) and NH2 groups by H-bound ligands, before further π-bound ligands are attached to the aromatic ring.33,36,39,40,42
Fig. 7 plots the ν1 frequencies of the most stable isomers for a variety of A(H)+−Arn (a) and A(H)+–(N2)n (b) complexes as a function of the cluster size n.
The A(H)+ ions include monohydroxyarene radical cations (A+ = Ph+, t-1-Np+, c-1-Np+) as well as carbenium ions of PhH+, which all possess a single OH group.
The plots mirror the preferred evolution of the solvation (sub)shells in these clusters, denoted H/(n − 1)π.
The first H-bound ligand induces a large ν1 red shift because of the destabilization of the O–H bond upon intermolecular H-bonding.
The size of Δν1 is correlated with the strength of the intermolecular interaction.
Thus, |Δν1| is larger for N2 dimers than for Ar dimers and increases for rising OH acidity in the order c-1-Np+< t-1-Np+ < PhH+ < Ph+, which is also reflected by decreasing ν1 frequencies of the bare monomers (n = 0).
The H-bound dimers (n = 1) are further solvated by π-bound ligands, which induce small incremental blue shifts of ν1.
Thus, π-bound ligands slightly destabilize the intermolecular H-bond to the first ligand via noncooperative three-body forces, which in turn stabilize the intramolecular O–H bond.
As expected, the ν1 frequencies are not converged at the largest cluster size investigated (n ≤ 7), because the first solvent shell around A(H)+ is not complete yet.
The ν1 shift for t-Np+–(N2)5 of −77 cm−1 amounts to 2.15%.
Unfortunately, neither Ar nor N2 matrix isolation studies are available for any of these aromatic A(H)+ ions,81 preventing comparison of the A(H)+–Ln cluster band shifts with the bulk limit (n → ∞).
The complexation-induced red shift in the proton donor stretch vibration, ΔνX–H, of H-bound X–H+–L dimers is correlated with the difference in the proton affinities (PA) of the two bases X and L.18,30,33,70,82
The smaller PA(X)–PA(L), the stronger the intermolecular H–L bond and the larger ΔνX–H.
This relation may be used to estimate unknown PA values of bases X from IR spectra of their X–H+–L dimers.
Recently, this procedure was applied to XH+ = In+ to obtain the first experimental determination of the PA of the indolyl radical.37
Fig. 8 plots the relative red shifts |ΔνX–H|/νX–H as a function of PA(X) for a series of H-bound XH+–N2 and XH+–Ar dimers, including XH+ = SiOH+, Ph+, In+, An+, and t-1-Np+ (Table 4).
The shifts are larger for L = N2 compared to L = Ar, because PA(N2) > PA(Ar) (494 > 369 kJ mol−1).83
For a given L, the shifts decrease in the order XH+ = SiOH+ > Ph+ > t-1-Np+ > In+ > An+ because of increasing PA(X).
The PA of the t-1-naphthoxy radical has not been measured so far.
Linear interpolation from the known PA values of the anilino and phenoxy radicals yields PA ≈ 908 ± 5 kJ mol−1 for t-1-naphthoxy (Fig. 8).
As the uncertainty of this method for determining PA values is not well documented, the error is enlarged to ±30 kJ mol−1, yielding 908 ± 30 kJ mol−1.
The PA of c-1-naphthoxy is predicted to be larger by around 10 kJ mol−1 according to the smaller Δν1 values.
This example demonstrates that IR spectroscopy of cluster ions can be used to selectively probe thermochemical properties, such as the PA, of specific conformers of transient radicals.
The attraction in weakly H-bound XH+–L dimers arises mainly from electrostatic and inductive forces.30,56
In general, the H-bond strength correlates with the positive partial charge located on the intermediate proton, qH.44
The larger qH, the more acidic the OH group and the larger the donation of electron density into the aromatic ring.
Because delocalization of the positive charge is more pronounced for 1-Np+ than for Ph+, as also indicated by the lower ionization potential, the donation of electron density from the OH group to the ring is smaller for 1-Np+.19
Consequently, the dissociation energies of H-bound 1-Np+–L are systematically lower than those of Ph+–L.
This trend is not only observed for nonpolar ligands, such as Ar and N2 (Table 1), but also for polar ligands, such as H2O: D0(H)/cm−1 = 6520 ± 50 and 5547 ± 75 for Ph+–H2O and t-1-Np+–H2O, respectively.15–17
On the other hand, t-1-Np appears to be slightly more acidic than Ph in S0, as is indicated by the slightly stronger H-bond to H2O: D0(H)/cm−1 = 2035 ± 69 and 1916 ± 50 for t-1-Np–H2O and Ph–H2O, respectively.9,15
Spectroscopic and theoretical data demonstrate that neutral 1-Np is a much stronger H-bond donor than H2O. For example, the dissociation energy of t-1-Np–H2O (D0 = 2035 ± 69 cm−1)9 is approximately twice that of H2O–H2O (D0 ∼ 1200 cm−1),84,85 leading to a larger red shift of the proton donor stretch frequency, −148 vs. −56 cm−1.12,86
The reversed situation is observed for the cationic species, for which H2O+ is a much better H-bond donor than 1-Np+.
For example, the dissociation energy of H-bound H2O+–Ar is much larger than that of 1-Np+–Ar, D0 ∼ 2100 ± 700 vs. 650 ± 150 cm−1, accompanied by larger frequency shifts, Δν1 = −541 vs. −41 cm−1.56,57
The delocalization of the positive charge in the aromatic π-electron system implies that the OH group in 1-Np+ is much less acidic than those of H2O+.
In conclusion, the acidity of neutral ROH increases along the series H2O < Ph < 1-Np, whereas for the ROH+ cations the trend is reversed, H2O+ > Ph+ > 1-Np+.
The Δν1 shifts of A(H)+–Arn and A(H)+–(N2)n as a function of n (Fig. 7) demonstrate that the acidity of the OH group strongly depends on both the solvent type and the degree of solvation.
Asymmetric solvation of A(H)+ by the weak proton acceptors Ar and N2 in the first solvation shell indicates that the acidity of the OH group is most enhanced for the H-bound dimers, because ν1 is smallest for n = 1.
Further solvation with π-bound ligands reduces the acidity again.
This effect is typical for interior ion solvation by surrounding polar and nonpolar ligands, because three-body polarization forces are noncooperative.50,56,87–90
Thus, even in the limit n → ∞, proton transfer from A(H)+ to the solvent is not expected to occur for these A(H)+–Arn and A(H)+–(N2)n complexes.55
In contrast, for strong proton acceptors, such as L = H2O and NH3, which are able to form H-bonded solvent networks, the PA of the Ln cluster increases drastically with n.
Thus, for such A(H)+–Ln complexes, the H-bond between A(H)+ and the Ln network becomes stronger as n increases, because three-body polarization forces are large and cooperative.88,89
Consequently, proton transfer from A(H)+ to Ln can be observed for complexes larger than a critical size.
For example, proton transfer occurs in Ph+–(H2O)n for n > 2 8 and in Bz+–(H2O)n for n > .388,89
At present, it is not established how many H2O ligands are required to induce proton transfer in t/c-Np+–(H2O)n.
ZEKE and MATI spectra of t-1-Np+–H2O show that the proton is not transferred for n = .116,17
As both 1-Np+ rotamers are less acidic than Ph+, it is expected that at least n > 2 is required for t/c-Np+–(H2O)n.
The acidity of the t/c-1-Np+ rotamers and their microsolvation in nonpolar hydrophobic solvents have been investigated by DFT calculations and IR spectra of size-selected 1-Np+–Arn (n ≤ 2) and 1-Np+–(N2)n (n ≤ 5) complexes.
Analysis of the n- and L-dependent complexation-induced frequency shifts of the O–H stretch vibration (Δν1) and photofragmentation branching ratios of 1-Np+–Ln provides information about the microsolvation of both 1-Np+ rotamers in Ar and N2.
The IR spectra demonstrate that the preferred ion–ligand binding motif between 1-Np+ and Ar/N2 is H-bonding to the acidic OH group, whereas π-bonding to the aromatic ring is less favorable.
Consequently, the preferred 1-Np+–Ln cluster growth begins with the formation of H-bound 1-Np+–L dimers, which are further solvated by (n − 1) π-bound ligands.
In general, the H/π-bonds in 1-Np+–(N2)n are stronger than those in 1-Np+–Arn, mainly because of the additional charge–quadrupole interaction in the N2 complexes. t-1-Np+ is found to be slightly more acidic than c-1-Np+ but both 1-Np+ rotamers are considerably less acidic than Ph+.
Increasing charge delocalization causes the acidity of ROH+ cations to decrease along the order H2O+ > Ph+ > 1-Np+, a trend opposite to the one observed for the corresponding neutral ROH molecules.
The Δν1 shifts of H-bound t-1-Np+–L yield a first experimental estimate for the proton affinity of the t-1-naphoxy radical as ∼908 ± 30 kJ mol−1, demonstrating that IR spectroscopy of cluster ions can be used to probe thermochemical properties of transient radicals.
The most stable 1-Np+–Ar structure (H-bound) differs qualitatively from that of the neutral dimer (π-bound), emphasizing the large impact of ionization on the interaction potential and the preferred recognition motif between aromatic molecules and nonpolar ligands.
The ionization-induced switch in the preferred binding type in A(+)–Ar from π-bonding to H-bonding has now been established for a large variety of A(+) molecules with acidic functional YHk groups (Y = O, N) and seems to be a general phenomenon.
Significantly, the t/c-1-Np+–Ln complexes were generated in an EI cluster ion source, which predominantly produces the most stable structure of a given cluster ion.
The global minimum structure found for t-1-Np+–Ar (H-bound) differs from the geometry observed in photoionization spectra (π-bound), demonstrating that the EI source is more generally applicable than photoionization for the spectroscopic characterization of global minima of cation complexes.
Ice template-assisted assembly of spherical PS-b-PAA micelles into novel layer-by-layer hollow spheres
Novel microscale layer-by-layer hollow spheres are template-assembled by monodispersed spherical PS-b-PAA micelles during the sublimation of the frozen micellar solution.
The aggregation of nanoscale building blocks, such as clusters,1 spheres,2,3 and superlattices,4–6 has attracted intense interest due to their importance in fundamental research and potential wide-ranging applications.
To date, a wealthy of methods have been developed to assemble nanoparticles into two- and three-dimensional ordered aggregates, which offers opportunities to explore their novel collective optical, magnetic, and electronic properties.7–10
For examples, Xia et al7. produced various uniform aggregates of spherical colloids following an approach combining physical template and capillary forces.
Jenekhe and Chen11 obtained periodic structures assembled by poly(phenylquinoline)-block-polystyrene via solution evaporation.
Stucky et al12. gained micro-sized hollow spheres co-assembled by silica and gold nanoparticles based on cysteine–lysine diblock copolypeptides.
These novel structures have potential applications ranging from electro-optical devices 13,14 and separation membranes 15,16 to active biomaterial coating 17,18 and nano-reactors.18,19
Our group has been studying the micellization of amphiphilic block copolymers and the ordered aggregation of the polymeric micelles.20,21
Recently, we have prepared various morphological aggregates of micelles via different methods.21
One strategy is to control ordered flower-like aggregation of micelles on a adjustable template of water polycrystal.
The present study is focused on the formation of novel layer-by-layer hollow polymeric spheres by ice template-assisted aggregation of nanoscale micelles.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of obtaining such novel layer-by-layer hollow aggregates via such a simple and convenient method.
The PS30-b-PAA51 micelles were firstly prepared as described elsewhere21 and characterized by dynamic laser scattering (DLS) and transform electronic microscopy (TEM).
A drop of the aqueous micelle solution was first placed onto a clean glass slide and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Then the ice in the frozen micellar sample was sublimated by freeze-drying under vacuum and the resultant samples were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
Furthermore, the crystal formation process of pure water was monitored by polarized light microscopy (PLM).
Fig. 1a shows the hydrodynamic diameter (Dh) distribution f(Dh) of the PS30-b-PAA51 micelles in aqueous solution obtained from DLS.
Obviously, the diameter distribution of the micelles is monodispersed and the average Dh of the micelles is about 58 nm.
Fig. 1b displays the TEM images of the micelles and we can clearly see the spherical shape of the micelles with about 40 nm in diameter.
It must be noted that the hydrodynamic diameter Dh of the micelles measured by DLS is much larger than that observed by TEM.
This is because the micelles are swollen in water due to the soluble PAA block, while TEM observation shows the dried aggregates.
Usually, nanoparticles dispersed in water, such as the micelles shown in Fig. 1, aggregate to form random-shaped clusters when the water is removed.
In order to achieve controlled aggregation of the nanoparticles, physical templates are usually used.7
Can the solvent be used directly as a template to control the aggregation?
To the best of our knowledge, liquid water is not a suitable candidate, but ice may be.
Compared with other templates that can be added, the ice template can be formed and removed easily by freezing and sublimating.
Fig. 2 gives the typical PLM image of the thin layer of ice template formed by freezing a drop of water in liquid nitrogen.
The dark grid-like lines as shown in Fig. 2 divide the ice film into many micro-regions.
These micro-regions are supposed to shrink gradually to form spherical micro-regions during the slow sublimation of H2O, which is similar to the sublimation of ice in winter.
Thus, it is reasonable to think that ice as shown in Fig. 2 can be used as a template to guide the aggregation of the micelles.
Herein, we aim to use this template to fulfil the controlled aggregation of the micelles shown in Fig. 1.
Upon first rapidly freezing the micellar aqueous solution in liquid nitrogen and then freeze-drying, the resultant samples were observed by SEM and the SEM images are shown in Fig. 3.
The resultant sample shown in Fig. 3a looks greatly different from the spheres in Fig. 1b.
The most remarkable difference is the broken hollow spheres containing a cavity encapsulating a smaller spherical particle and the outer shell is about 100 nm in thickness, which can be seen in the insert-enlarged image in Fig. 3a.
The fine structure of the shell can be seen in Fig. 3b.
Obviously, the shell is formed by the packed small particles, which corresponds to the nanoscale spherical PS30-b-PAA51 micelles.
These results confirm that the microscale layer-by-layer hollow spheres are just resulted from the assembly of the nanoscale PS30-b-PAA51 micelles.
Thus, it can be concluded that the ice template plays a key role in the ordered assembly of the dispersed PS30-b-PAA51 micelles in water.
According to what we have obtained above, we propose a schematic illustration of the ice template-assisted assembly of the nanoscale micelles into layer-by-layer hollow spheres in Fig. 4.
The first step is to freeze the micellar solution instantly (A in Fig. 4), where the micelles are uniformly dispersed in the ice template.
It should be noted out the ice template is divided into many micro-regions as schematically magnified in step B. Second, during the H2O sublimation process, the micro-regions in the ice template gradually shrink and become spherical and the micelles adhered to the surface of the micro-regions in the ice template are piled gradually into a three-dimensional (3D) spherical arrangement (B→C→D).
Sublimation continuously, a spherical core-shell structure forms (E), where the shell is composed of the packed nanoscale PS30-b-PAA51 micelles and the core is still the frozen micellar solution.
The further sublimation of H2O molecule existing in the frozen core results in formation of a cavity between the obtained spherical polymeric shell layer and the shrunk frozen core (F).
Further continuing the sublimation of H2O under high vacuum state till the ice template is completely removed, the novel layer-by-layer polymeric spheres (G) are obtained.
In summary, we have presented a convenient and simple approach to assemble nanoscale micelles into novel microscale layer-by-layer polymeric hollow spheres.
This method can be extended to general polymeric micelles dispersed in water.
We believe the method will broad a new way to produce novel structures as shown in this study.
Calculations of the site specific stretching frequencies of CO adsorbed on Li+/ZSM-5
Interaction of the CO molecule with Li+ within ZSM-5 was investigated by means of the combined quantum mechanics/interaction potential function method.
Both, C-on and O-on species were considered.
The scaling method based on the linear correlation between CO bond length and stretching frequency has been applied to calculate CO frequencies in CO(OC)–Li+/ZSM-5 adsorption complexes.
Three types of C-on adsorption complexes with different r(CO) bond lengths, ν(CO) frequencies, and CO binding energies were identified.
The calculated IR spectra of CO adsorbed on the Li+/ZSM-5 system show three distinctive bands at about 2194 cm−1, 2187 cm−1 and 2183 cm−1 for C-on complexes and at about 2116 cm−1, 2114 cm−1 and 2104 cm−1 for O-on complexes, in excellent agreement with experimental data.
Calculated adsorption energies and CO stretching frequencies were used for the simulation of the IR spectra at various CO coverages.
Metal exchanged zeolites have been intensively studied by numerous experimental and theoretical groups due to their remarkable catalytic activity.
The properties of the catalytically active sites depend on the structure and coordination of the exchanged metal cations.
The structure of the active sites in aluminium-rich zeolites can be determined from X-ray and neutron diffraction experiments.1,2
In high silica zeolites with a low content of alkali metal cations, however, information about the metal coordination is obtained mainly from indirect experimental techniques, including the spectroscopic characterization of probe molecules interacting with various types of cationic sites.
Carbon monoxide is one of the most common probe molecules for FTIR measurements on metal exchanged zeolites due to a high sensitivity of the CO stretching frequency to the metal cation coordination with the surrounding zeolite framework.
IR spectra of CO interacting with alkali metals in zeolites show a strong adsorption band blue-shifted with respect to the frequency of gaseous CO (2143 cm−1) and a weak band with a frequency below 2143 cm−1.3,4
It was assumed that the high-frequency band is due to the CO stretching of a C-on adsorption complex, while the low-frequency band was assigned to an O-on adsorption complex.4–7
The existence of M(OC)+ species was also considered in theoretical studies of the CO interaction with alkali metal cations in zeolites.4,5
By means of variable-temperature IR measurements of CO adsorbed on Na+/ZSM-5, Otero-Arean et al8. showed that the appearance of low and high-frequency bands in the CO–M+/ZSM-5 (M+ = alkali metal) systems reflects an isomerisation equilibrium between the C-on and O-on monocarbonyl species rather than the existence of different cationic sites.
The adsorption of CO on Li+/ZSM-5 has been studied by several experimental groups.3,9,10
Various coordination complexes formed upon CO adsorption on Li+/ZSM-5 were used to explain variable-temperature IR spectroscopy measurements for different CO pressures.11
The IR bands at 2195 and 2187 cm−1 were assigned to Li+(CO) and Li+(CO)2 species, and the weak bands at 2110 and 2102 cm−1 were assigned to Li+(OC)(CO) and Li+(OC) species, respectively.
Based on the results of microcalorimetric measurements Savitz et al. doubted a formation of Li+ dicarbonyl species.9
At coverages only slightly above monolayer the observed differential heats of adsorption for CO rapidly dropped to the value measured on silicalite.
Therefore, it was concluded that in contrast to other alkali metal cations the second CO molecule is mostly unable to approach the Li+ sites.
By means of combining FTIR spectroscopic and microcalorimetric measurements Bonelli et al10. suggested that bands at 2193 and 2187 cm−1 are both due to Li(CO)+ species formed on two different types of Li+ sites.
The possibility of a new interpretation of a low-frequency region in light of the existence of these two sites was also considered.
The coordination of alkali metal ions in ZSM-5 was studied theoretically by a combined quantum mechanics/interatomic potential function method and two types of Li+ sites were found depending on the framework Al atom position:12 (i) type I sites where alkali metal ions are coordinated to 3–4 oxygen atoms of the 5- or 6-member ring on the channel wall (denoted M5 or M6 and Z5 or Z6 for sites on the wall of main and zig-zag channels, respectively) and (ii) type II sites where the metal cation is coordinated to two oxygen atoms of the single AlO4 tetrahedron on the intersection edge (denoted as I2 sites).
The notation for alkali metal sites in ZSM-5 introduced in ref. 12 is used in this work (Fig. 1).
The population of type I sites is expected to be larger than the population of type II sites for Li+/ZSM-.512
In this paper the results of a computational study of CO interaction with various types of Li+ sites are used for the interpretation of the IR spectra of CO/Li+/ZSM-5.
This study combined the quantum mechanics/interatomic potential function (QM-Pot)13 method with the scaling method based on the correlation between the CO bond length and the CO stretching frequency (ωCO–rCO correlation).
This approach has been used recently for the interpretation of the IR spectra of CO interacting with Cu+/ZSM-.514
The ωCO–rCO scaling method was developed for the assessment of highly accurate vibrational frequencies of metal ion carbonyl species interacting with complex molecular environments.
The method combines quantum chemistry approaches directly applicable to the “real” system with benchmark calculations (typically at the CCSD(T) level of theory) on selected model molecules.
The combined QM-Pot method13 has been used to study CO interaction with the Li+ sites in ZSM-5.
Within this approach, the system is divided into two parts: the inner part described at a DFT level (with BLYP exchange–correlation functional15,16) and the outer part described at the computationally less expensive interatomic potential function (IPF) level.
Dangling bonds on the inner part boundary were saturated with hydrogen atoms.
Periodic boundary conditions were applied to the unit cell consisting of 192 T-atoms (191 Si atoms and 1 Al atom) and 384 O atoms.
Rather large definitions of inner parts (described at the DFT level) were used in order to properly account for the CO interaction with framework atoms from the opposite side of the channel wall.14
The inner part consisted of a CO molecule, Li atom, AlO4 tetrahedron and from 12 to 25 SiO4 tetrahedra (13-T to 26-T models, respectively), depending on the particular Li+ site location.
Examples of inner parts used in calculations are given in Fig. 2.
The CO stretching frequencies were calculated from the ωCO–rCO correlation,14 using the QM-Pot model with large inner part definition.
Calculations were performed with valence-triple-ζ-plus-polarization function basis set for C, O and Li atoms and valence-double-ζ-plus-polarization function basis set for Al, Si, and H atoms (denoted BS2).17,18
The resolution of identity approximation19,20 was used in BLYP calculations, employing the (9s2p2d1f)/[7s2p2d1f], (12s6p5d1f1g)/[5s3p2d1f1g], (12s6p5d1f)/[5s3p2d1f], (9s3p3d1f)/[7s3p3d1f], (9s3p3d1f)/[7s3p3d1f], and (4s2p1d)/[3s2p1d] auxiliary basis sets21–23 for Li, Si, Al, C, O and H atoms, respectively.
The interactions between the atoms of the outer part and the interactions between atoms of the inner and outer parts were treated at the IPF level, employing the core-shell model potentials developed previously.12,24
The interaction between the CO molecule and zeolite framework was treated with the Lennard-Jones potential with parameters derived from the universal force field.25
Atomic charges on carbon and oxygen atoms of CO were taken from the NBO (natural bond orbital) analysis obtained for the CO/Li+AlSi2O10H8 cluster (±0.4570 and ±0.5710 e for C-on and O-on complexes, respectively).
The interaction parameters for the interaction between the CO molecule with Li+ were not defined since these atoms are always included in the inner part definition (QM) which is treated at the DFT level.
The performance of the BLYP/BS2 level used in calculations on CO/Li+/ZSM-5 can be judged based on the data summarized in Tables 1 and 2 comparing BLYP, B3LYP, MP2 and CCSD(T) results.
Calculations of the CO structural parameters were carried out for 12 distinguishable framework Al positions within the orthorhombic symmetry using the numbering scheme proposed by Koningsveld et al.26
In all cases, both C-on and O-on complexes were considered.
The CO equilibrium distances and stretching frequencies for a series of model molecules were calculated at the CCSD(T), MP2 and DFT levels.
At the DFT level, the BLYP and B3LYP exchange–correlation functionals15,16,27 were employed.
At the MP2 and DFT levels the geometries were fully optimized using the BS2 basis set defined above.
The CCSD(T) calculations were carried out with the correlation consistent valence-quadruple-ζ basis set with polarization functions28,29 (cc-pVQZ), denoted as BS1.
Three geometry parameters (Al–Li, Li–C and C–O distances) were varied in the CCSD(T) optimization for Al(OH)4−⋯Li+CO and Al(OH)4−⋯Li+OC clusters (1-T model), all other parameters were held fixed at the corresponding BLYP/BS2 equilibrium values.
The CCSD(T) frequencies were evaluated using the two-dimensional (Li–C, C–O) stretching Hamiltonian (see ref. 14 for more details).
Charge distribution analysis was carried out at the natural bond orbital (NBO) level.30
The ab initio calculations of Xn⋯Li+CO and Xn⋯Li+OC clusters were performed using MOLPRO (CCSD(T)) and Gaussian (MP2, DFT) program suites.31,32
The calculations on CO/Li+/ZSM-5 were carried out with QM-Pot program13 which makes use of the TurboDFT19 and Gulp33 programs for DFT and IPF calculations, respectively.
The CO equilibrium distances and stretching frequencies of C-on and O-on complexes for Li+CO, H2O⋯Li+CO, (H2O)2⋯Li+CO, F−⋯Li+CO and (F−)2⋯Li+CO model molecules calculated at the CCSD(T), DFT (employing the BLYP and B3LYP exchange correlation functional), and MP2 levels are summarized in Table 1.
The ωCO–rCO correlation derived from calculated data covers the CO frequency range 2108–2224 cm−1 and 2060–2157 cm−1 for C-on and O-on complexes, respectively.
Throughout this work we assume the constant anharmonic correction for the CO stretching vibration of 29 cm−1 calculated previously for monocarbonyl species in various molecular environments.14,34
The Δω correction introduced in eqns. (1) and (2) in ref. 14 was estimated from a comparison of the scaled and CSSD(T) frequencies calculated for the 1-T model which possesses the most important features of the cationic sites in the CO/Li+/ZSM-5 system.
Parameters of the ωCO–rCO correlation (see ref. 14) for Li+-exchanged zeolites are given in Table 3.
The scaled harmonic frequencies are evaluated from the following equationωCO[cm−1] = arCO [Å] + b + Δω,where rCO is the equilibrium CO distance obtained from DFT or MP2 geometry optimization.
The Δω correction in eqn. (1) is defined as the difference between the CO harmonic frequency calculated for the 1-T cluster model at the CCSD(T) level and the corresponding scaled ωCO.
The parameters a, b, and Δω are basis set dependent and, therefore, they have to be used only with the BS2 basis employed in our calculations on the CO/Li+/ZSM-5 system.
As can be seen from Table 2, the BSSE corrected CO binding energies for the 1-T model calculated at the B3LYP and BLYP levels agree with CCSD(T) values to within 0.3 kcal mol−1, slightly worse agreement was found for MP2 (0.6 kcal mol−1).
The DFT/BLYP level used in this work seems to underestimate binding energies for monocarbonyl species by 0.2–0.3 kcal mol−1.
The calculated zero-point energy (ZPE) corrections are essentially the same at the DFT and MP2 levels.
The results for Li+(CO)2, Li+(OC)CO and Li+(OC)2 species (1-T cluster model) are also summarized in Table 2.
The CO stretching modes in dicarbonyls are only weakly coupled and therefore, a single band is expected to appear in the FTIR spectra.11
The calculated splitting of a1 and b2 CO frequencies (1-T model, C2v symmetry) is less than 2 cm−1 at all levels of theory.
The fact that geminal dicarbonyls behave as independent oscillators was also reported for Na+(CO)2 species in Na-Y zeolite.35
The relative positions of the dicarbonyl C-on and O-on bands with respect to their monocarbonyl counterparts can be estimated by comparing the results for the 1-T model (Table 2).
At the BLYP level the CO stretching frequencies of C-on and O-on dicarbonyls are shifted by about −14 cm−1 and +5 cm−1, respectively.
The binding energies for the second CO ligand in the dicarbonyl species are significantly lower than for the corresponding monocarbonyls (BLYP binding energies are −2.8 kcal mol−1 and −1.5 kcal mol−1 for C-on and O-on species, respectively).
Similar results were obtained at the B3LYP level.
Two types of Li+ sites were identified in ZSM-5 by Kučera et al.12
It was shown that the relative stability of the type I and type II sites depends on the location of the framework Al atom.12
When the framework Al is at T4, T8, T10, or T11 only the channel wall sites (type I) were found.
However, for all other positions of framework aluminium both type I and type II sites coexist (.ref. 12)
The stability of type I and type II sites is roughly the same when Al is at T2, T3, T6, or T12.
The type I site is slightly more stable (about 3 kcal mol−1) than the type II site when Al is at T1, T5, T7, T9 (see Supplementary data of .ref. 12)
The interaction of CO with both Li+ site types was considered in this study.
Interaction energies (including BSSE and ZPE), r(CO) bond lengths, and CO frequencies are summarized in Table 4 for both C-on and O-on adsorption complexes.
Based on the interaction energies and vibrational frequencies the CO/Li+/ZSM-5 complexes can be divided into three groups: (i) intersection complexes (type II complexes) where upon interaction with CO the Li+ ion stays coordinated to just two oxygen atoms of a single AlO4 tetrahedron located at the intersection edge, (ii) channel wall complexes where an AlO4 tetrahedron is located on the intersection edge (type Ia complexes), and (iii) channel wall complexes where an AlO4 tetrahedron is located on the channel wall (type I complexes).
Type I complexes can be found only when framework aluminium is at T4, T8, T10, or T11 positions.
Type Ia complexes are always adjacent to intersection sites and these complexes can be viewed as channel wall complexes in the vicinity of a channel intersection.
For type I and type Ia complexes the Li+ ion is coordinated to 3–4 oxygen atoms of five- or six-member ring containing AlO4 tetrahedron.
As noted above for a framework Al atom located on the intersection edge both type I and type II complexes can be found.
Examples of all CO/Li+/ZSM-5 complex types are depicted in Fig. 2.
The Li+ ion is considered to be coordinated to a framework oxygen atom if the Li+–O distance is shorter than 2.33 Å.12
Coordination of the Li+ ion remains the same upon interaction with the CO molecule and the Li+ ion positions are only slightly influenced by the CO adsorption.
The Li–O bonds typically do not lengthen by more than 0.02 and 0.1 Å upon the CO adsorption for intersection and channel wall complexes, respectively (Table 5).
The only exception is the M7/T7 site (Li+ located at M7 site/Al atom at T7 position), where Li+ was originally coordinated to 3 framework oxygen atoms of the six-member ring and upon CO adsorption the Li+ ion loses the coordination to the non-AlO4 oxygen atoms and is coordinated as at other intersection sites.
The C-on OC–Li+/ZSM-5 complex is typically more stable by about 2 kcal mol−1 than the O-on CO-Li+/ZSM-5 complex for a particular Li+ site.
In a few cases this difference is smaller and in one case (I2/T5 site) the O-on complex is more stable by 0.4 kcal mol−1 than the C-on complex.
However, this may be an artefact of the model used (large partial charges on C and O atoms used for O-on complexes, for discussion see the next section).
First we discuss the C-on adsorption complexes.
The CO molecule is most strongly bound at intersection (type II) sites.
For these adsorption complexes the CO stretching vibration shows the largest shift to higher frequency compared to the gas phase CO (blue-shift of 50 cm−1).
The interaction energies are from −6.1 to −7.6 kcal mol−1 and νCO are in the range 2191–2197 cm−1.
Slightly weaker CO interactions with Li+/ZSM-5 (–5.0 to –5.7 kcal mol−1) and smaller CO frequencies (2184–2190 cm−1) were found for type Ia sites.
The smallest CO interaction energies (−3.4 to −4.2 kcal mol−1) were found for type I sites where also the νCO frequencies are the smallest (2182–2183 cm−1).
The differences in νCO and the interaction energies between intersection and channel wall complexes are due to the large changes in the Li+ ion coordination.
However, in both channel wall complexes (type I and Ia) the Li+ is three- or four-coordinated to the zeolite framework atom.
The differences in νCO and interaction energies are mainly due to the changes in Li+⋯Of distances that are shorter in type I sites than in type Ia sites.
The details of Li+ ion coordination at selected sites and details of the Li+ ion coordination at corresponding OC–Li+/ZSM-5 complexes are summarized in Table 5.
The relative stability of O-on complexes increases in the same order as found for C-on complexes (I < Ia < II).
However, the CO stretching frequencies increase for O-on complexes in the opposite order to the C-on complexes.
This seemingly surprising behavior can be understood in terms of the character of occupied molecular orbitals of CO (see next section for details).
The calculated CO stretching frequencies for C-on OC–Li+/ZSM-5 complexes are in the range 2182–2197 cm−1, in excellent agreement with experimental data.3,10,11
The calculated blue-shift in CO frequencies is due to two completely independent effects: first, the interaction of CO with alkali metal cations causes a change in polarization of the bonding molecular orbitals (this will be discussed below) and, second, the oxygen atom of the CO molecule (OCO) has a repulsive interaction with the opposite side of the channel wall.
Comparing the CO frequencies calculated using small models (not accounting for the repulsion with the opposite side of the channel wall) and using large models (properly describing the CO interaction with the zeolite framework) we conclude that the effect of the channel wall on ν(CO) is 11–13 cm−1.
This effect does not depend on the Li+ coordination number nor on the structure of the OC–Li+/ZSM-5 adsorption complex.
This is significantly less than found recently for the OC–Cu+/ZSM-5 system14 where an effect as large as 20 cm−1 was observed.
In fact, in the OC–Cu+/ZSM-5 system the blue-shift of the CO frequencies upon the adsorption was found to be purely due to the repulsive interaction with the channel wall.
The relatively small effect of the channel wall repulsion on ν(CO) found for the OC–Li+/ZSM-5 system seemingly contradicts the results of the charge distribution analysis on the C and O atoms (the NBO charges are ±0.3565 and ±0.4570 e for the OC–Cu+/ZSM-5 and OC–Li+/ZSM-5 systems, respectively).
The large CO polarization found for the OC–Li+/ZSM-5 system implies a strong electrostatic repulsion between the OCO and framework oxygen atoms (Of) and, therefore, a large blue-shift of ν(CO) due to this repulsion could be anticipated.
To understand the relative magnitude of the channel wall effect for the Li+/ZSM-5 and Cu+/ZSM-5 systems it is important to compare the nature of the CO interaction in these systems.
In order to bind CO efficiently the Cu+ ion changes its coordination with the zeolite framework and stays coordinated to just two oxygen atoms of the single framework AlO4 tetrahedron upon the interaction with the CO molecule.
In the OC–Cu+/ZSM-5 adsorption complex the Cu+ ion has trigonal planar hybridization with the CO bond in the Of–Cu–Of plane (Of framework atom in coordination with Cu+).
In this system it is energetically advantageous to keep the trigonal planar hybridization on Cu+ at the expense of a small increase of OCO repulsion with the zeolite channel wall.
On the contrary, the Li+ coordination with the framework remains unchanged upon the formation of the OC–Li+/ZSM-5 adsorption complex.
The interaction of CO with Li+/ZSM-5 is almost entirely electrostatic in nature, therefore, it is only important to keep the Li+⋯CO coordination linear (in order to maximize the monopole–dipole interaction) and the orientation of Li+⋯CO with respect to the zeolite framework is relatively energy independent.
Thus, the OC–Li+/ZSM-5 complex structure is driven by the minimization of the OCO⋯Of repulsion.
As a result the blue-shift in ν(CO) is smaller in OC–Li+/ZSM-5 than in the OC–Cu+/ZSM-5 system.
Based on the CO stretching frequencies and interaction energies three groups of OC–Li+/ZSM-5 complexes can be distinguished.
The largest ν(CO) and largest CO interaction energies were found for the OC–Li+/ZSM-5 adsorption complexes on the channel intersection (type II) while the smallest ν(CO) and smallest interaction energies were found for complexes on the channel wall sites (type I complexes).
The differences in CO frequencies are not due to the effect of the channel wall repulsion (see above), instead, it can be explained by the differences in Li+ coordination in particular site types.
The almost purely electrostatic interaction of CO with Li+/ZSM-5 depends on the partial charge on the Li+ ion in a particular site in ZSM-5.
The NBO analysis shows a larger partial charge on Li+ for both bare Li+/ZSM-5 and OC–Li+/ZSM-5 models, shorter r(CO) distance, and larger Wiberg bond index for type II sites on the channel intersection than for type I sites on the channel wall.
The charge on the Li+ ions becomes smaller with an increasing number of framework oxygen atoms in coordination with Li+.
In addition, the partial charge on Li+ increases with the increasing average Li–Of bond length.
The average Li–Of bond length is larger in type Ia sites than in type I sites.
It can be concluded that with the increasing coordination of Li+ with the framework the charge on Li+ becomes smaller and, therefore, the CO interaction with Li+/ZSM-5 becomes weaker, CO bond polarization smaller, and CO frequency smaller.
The experimentally determined IR bands at 2195 and 2187 cm−1 were originally assigned to mono- and di-carbonyl complexes with Li+/ZSM-.511
However, this interpretation is somewhat doubtful in terms of the results of microcalorimetric measurements.
Savitz et al. showed that the differential heats of adsorption rapidly drop above the monolayer coverage.9
The most recent IR experiments for the CO/Li+/ZSM-5 system were interpreted in terms of site-specific CO stretching frequencies for two types of Li+ sites in ZSM-.510
The experimental IR bands at 2193 and 2187 cm−1 were assigned to two types of Li+ sites characterized by different CO adsorption energies.
The shift of the 2187 cm−1 band to lower frequencies for CO coverage approaching monolayer was interpreted as a consequence of the formation of dicarbonyl species characterized by the IR band at 2185 cm−1.
We have attempted to estimate the CO frequency for dicarbonyl species from a simple 1-T model (Table 2).
The CO frequency calculated for dicarbonyl species from the ωCO–rCO correlation (2185 cm−1) thus supports the experimental interpretation of Bonelli et al.10
However, the calculated interaction energy for the second CO molecule is small compared to the interaction energy of the first CO molecule.
From the 1-T model calculations (Table 2) it appears that the second CO molecule interaction energy is only about 2–3 kcal mol−1 (including BSSE and ZPE corrections).
Our computational results predict three bands at about 2194, 2187 and 2183 cm−1 in the IR spectra of CO adsorbed on Li+/ZSM-5, all of them due to the monocarbonyl C-on species.
These results offer an alternative interpretation of the experimentally observed frequency shifts in the IR spectra.
Since the sites with the least favorable binding energy show the lowest CO stretching frequency, changes in the CO coverage should result in corresponding changes in the spectra.
It can be expected that at high CO equilibrium pressure when nearly all the Li+ sites are populated the lower frequency component should peak at about 2185 cm−1.
Since the type I and Ia complexes represent a major fraction of Li+ sites, the lower frequency band should also predominate in the IR spectra at very high coverage.
Therefore, the experimental spectra can be interpreted in terms of monocarbonyl species only, without the need to invoke the existence of dicarbonyls.
The IR spectra of the CO/Li+/ZSM-5 system (Fig. 3) were calculated in order to compare theoretical and experimental results.
Calculated spectra are based on a simple model (see Appendix A) and it should be stressed that this model is by no means quantitative and it should only demonstrate that all the features of the experimental spectra can be attributed to the monocarbonyl species only.
At low CO coverage the spectra are dominated by the 2194 cm−1 band (type II sites on the channel intersection) where the CO interaction with Li+/ZSM-5 is the strongest.
However, it is apparent that even for a low CO coverage the spectra are not symmetrical showing a weak band at lower frequencies.
This lower frequency band becomes more populated with increasing CO coverage.
At about θ = 0.7 ML both bands have similar maximum.
At higher CO coverage the low frequency band maximum shifts to lower frequencies.
This shift is not due to the formation of dicarbonyl, instead it is due to the increasing population of type I sites relative to type Ia sites (Table 4).
Experimental IR spectra show qualitatively the same behavior (see Fig. 3 in .ref. 10)
The weak band in the 2100–2120 cm−1 region was assigned to O-bonded CO–Li+/ZSM-5 species.10
Calculated IR spectra for the O-on CO–Li+/ZSM-5 complexes show three types of Li+/ZSM-5 adsorption sites characterized by CO stretching bands at 2104, 2114 and 2116 cm−1 corresponding to type II, type Ia and type I Li+ sites, respectively.
Similarly as for C-on complexes the CO interaction energies for O-on complexes decreases from type II sites to type I sites.
For the O-on complexes the CO frequencies are smallest for type II sites and largest for type I sites, opposite to what was found for C-on complexes.
This behavior is in agreement with the IR experiments.
For a low CO coverage the experimental spectra exhibit a dominant peak at the lower energy part of the 2100–2120 cm−1 region while for a high CO coverage this spectral region is dominated by the higher energy band.
Based on the calculations the 2104 cm−1 band (type II site) predominates in the IR spectra at low coverage, while the 2116 cm−1 and 2114 cm−1 bands gain intensity with increasing equilibrium CO pressure.
The blue-shifting of the higher frequency band maximum may be difficult to observe because of very small differences in the CO frequency (2 cm−1) and low intensity.
Our estimate of the CO stretching frequency for dicarbonyl species calculated from 1-T model is about 2109 cm−1.
The opposite dependence of νCO on Li+ coordination (and thus on the partial charge on Li+) observed for C-on and O-on complexes can be qualitatively understood in terms of the polarization changes of bonding molecular orbitals in CO. The positive charge on the Li+ cation for the C-on complex partially reduces the polarization of σ and π bonding orbitals of the CO molecule and the CO bond becomes stronger.
On the contrary, the positive charge on the Li+ cation for the O-on complex increases the polarization of the bonding orbitals of CO, thus, it reduces the CO bond strength.36
In addition to σ polarization the effect of the opposite channel wall also contributes to the overall CO frequency.
Due to the positive sign of the partial charge on the carbon atom the interaction of carbon with the channel wall is attractive.
The estimated effect of the channel wall is a 12–14 cm−1 red-shift.
Both effects (orbital polarization and channel wall repulsion) shift the CO frequency towards the lower values for O-on species.
Interaction energies calculated for C-on complexes of type I and II are 4 and 7 kcal mol−1 in good agreement with available calorimetric data.9,10
The calculated interaction energies for O-on complex are lower by about 2–3 kcal mol−1, in good agreement with the estimate from variable-temperature IR experiments (2 kcal mol−1).37
However, for the I2/T5 site we found that the O-on complex is slightly more stable than the C-on complex.
The analysis of the model convergence (increasing the size of the inner part) shows that the interaction energies of O-on complexes depend on the model size more than C-on interaction energies or νCO of C-on or O-on complexes.
We believe that CO frequencies and interaction energies for C-on complexes are well converged with respect to the further enlargement of the inner part of the combined QM-Pot model.
However, interaction energies for O-on complexes should be calculated with even larger models than used in this study.
First, the partial charges on C and O atoms used for the O-on complexes are larger than those used for the C-on complexes (both based on NBO analysis) and, second, the carbon atom directing into the channel bears a positive partial charge, thus, the interaction of the C atom with framework oxygen atoms is attractive.
Calculations with the inner part consisting of 30–50 framework T-atoms could provide more reliable interaction energies for O-on complexes, however, due to the computational requirements of such calculations these were not carried out.
It should be stressed that reported O-on interaction energies should be interpreted only in a qualitative way.
Application of the scaling method developed for the assessment of highly accurate vibrational frequencies of metal ion carbonyl species interacting with the zeolite framework to the CO–Li+/ZSM-5 system demonstrates that the ωCO–rCO scaling approach is capable of predicting FTIR spectra of CO adsorbed on metal exchanged zeolites basically with CCSD(T) accuracy (to within a few wavenumbers).
The method is computationally favorable since it only requires performing the geometry optimization at the DFT level of theory.
The large reduction of CPU demands is achieved by the use of resolution of identity approximation.
To obtain reliable CO stretching frequencies one has to use a sufficiently large cluster model for the inner (QM) part definition of the QM-Pot computational scheme, namely interaction of the probe molecule with the opposite channel wall must be included.
Calculated CO stretching frequencies are in very good agreement with experimental data.3,10,11
Computational results support the conclusion of Bonelli et al10. that the CO frequencies are site specific for the CO/Li+/ZSM-5 system.
Bludský et al. recently used the same computational approach (combined QM-Pot approach together with a ωCO–rCO scaling method) in the investigation of the CO interaction with Cu+ exchanged ZSM-514 and concluded that CO frequencies are not site-specific in that system in agreement with experimental results.38
Similarly it has been concluded from the combination of computational and experimental study of the CO/Cu+/FER system that the CO stretching frequencies are not site-specific.39
The site-specificity of CO stretching frequencies found for the CO/Li+/ZSM-5 system by Bonelli et al. and theoretically confirmed here together with the interpretation of spectral features at the atomic scale level offers a variety of interesting applications.
Further exploration of this site-specificity for other high-silica zeolites where the information about the cation coordination and localization are difficult to obtain is in progress.
The calculated CO stretching frequencies for CO adsorbed on the Li+/ZSM-5 system show three distinctive bands at about 2194 cm−1, 2187 cm−1 and 2183 cm−1 for C-on complexes and at about 2116 cm−1, 2114 cm−1 and 2104 cm−1 for O-on complexes.
Theoretical predictions of IR spectra of the CO/Li+/ZSM-5 system are in excellent agreement with the available experimental data.
The formation of dicarbonyl species cannot be fully ruled out, however, the corresponding CO bands are likely to overlap with the spectral features due to the monocarbonyl species.
The site-specificity of CO frequencies in the CO/Li+/ZSM-5 system suggested by Bonelli et al10. is confirmed.
From a combination of experimental variable pressure IR spectra and the theoretical interpretation of individual spectral features information about the coordination, localization, and distribution (population) of extra-framework metal cations can be obtained.
The results obtained for CO/Li+/ZSM-5 together with the recently published results for CO/Cu+/ZSM-5 offer a new insight into the understanding of site-specificity of vibrational frequencies of the CO probe molecule.
CO frequencies in the CO/M+/ZSM-5 system are driven by CO interaction with the opposite site of the channel wall (repulsive interaction for the C-on complex resulting in the blue-shift in CO frequencies) and by the CO interaction with the metal cation.
The strong CO interaction with the Cu+ sites results in the changes in Cu+ coordination with the framework oxygen atoms.
The coordination and hybridization of the Cu+ ion is the same for all cationic sites upon interaction with CO and, as a consequence, the CO stretching frequencies are not site-specific in this system.
In addition, the CO⋯Cu+ interaction is stabilized by two effects, σ-donation (polarization) and π-backdonation, each of them having an opposite effect on the CO frequency.
As a consequence, CO adsorption energies and CO frequencies do not correlate.
On the contrary, the Li+ ion coordination does not change upon interaction with CO. The charge on the Li+ ion decreases with increasing Li+ coordination with the framework.
Both, the CO interaction energy for a particular Li+ site and the CO frequencies depend on the partial charge on the Li+ ion.
Therefore, the CO stretching frequencies for the CO/Li+/ZSM-5 system are site specific, probing the information about the Li+ coordination within the zeolite matrix.
In addition, the CO frequency correlates with the CO interaction energies.
It can be anticipated that the same rationalization will hold for other monovalent cations and other zeolite frameworks.
Oxidation potentials and electron donation to photosystem II of manganese complexes containing bicarbonate and carboxylate ligands
The oxidation potentials of MnII in aqueous solutions of bicarbonate, formate, acetate and oxalate are reported as a function of concentration and compared to the rate of photooxidation of these solutions by the Mn-depleted water-oxidizing complex of photosystem II (apo-WOC-PSII) from peas.
Although all the carboxylate species lower considerably the oxidation potential of MnII, only bicarbonate stimulates the electron transfer from MnII to apo-WOC-PSII.
On the basis of the electrochemical data it is proposed that the unique capability of Mn-bicarbonate complexes to be photooxidized by PSII could be due to four possible reasons: (i) significantly larger decrease in the oxidation potential of MnII (down to 0.52 V); (ii) electroneutrality of the functional electron transfer complex; (iii) the more favorable energetics reflected in the two pKa values for H2CO3/HCO3− and HCO3−/CO32− and greater number of proton transfer sites; and (iv) multiple composition possibilities for the MnIII photo-product as MnIII(HCO3−)3, MnIII(HCO3−)(CO32−) and MnIII(HCO3−)2(OH−) (due to the high Lewis acidity of MnIII (pK < 1).
Photosynthetic water oxidation produces molecular oxygen in photosystem II (PSII) of green plants and cyanobacteria.
Absorption of light in PSII antenna and reaction center (RC) of PSII induces charge separation between molecules of excited chlorophylls (P680) and pheophytin (free-base chlorophyll), with subsequent electron transfer steps to the first quinone acceptor QA.
The electron vacancy arising in P680+ is filled up by an electron donated ultimately by a water molecule (the terminal reductant of PSII).1,2
Substrate water is bound to an enzymatic water-oxidizing complex (WOC) comprised of Mn4Ca1Clx, redox-active tyrosine (Yz) and possibly bicarbonate.
The WOC serves the purpose of a redox catalyst (electron/proton reservoir) to deliver electrons one at a time to P680+ until four electron vacancies are accumulated resulting in oxidation of two H2O molecules to O2.
It is known that bicarbonate (HCO3−) ions are needed for maximum activity of PSII (for recent reviews, see refs. 3–6 and references therein).
The stimulating effect of HCO3− on PSII was primarily ascribed to the processes taking place on the donor side of PSII7 and a model including bicarbonate as a mediator for photosynthetic water oxidation has been given7,8 which, however, was in contradiction with the results of isotopic experiments.9
In addition, strong evidence is known for the action of bicarbonate on the electron acceptor side of PSII, where it promotes efficient re-oxidation of QA−.10
This role was supported by a number of compelling data, including evidence for binding of bicarbonate directly to the non-heme Fe located between QA and QB11,12 where it accelerates electron transfer between the quinones and may also serve as proton donor to the reduced QB.
Further, Xiong et al13. have suggested involvement of R-257 on D-1 protein in bicarbonate/formate binding through their site-directed mutagenesis studies.
These studies have led to a widely accepted model (for review, see ref. 4).
Recent data have shown a role for bicarbonate on the donor side, with specific evidence indicating a function in assembling the inorganic cofactors within apo-WOC (WOC-depleted of Mn, Ca and Cl cofactors), but also for sustaining oxygen-evolution activity.14–22
It was shown that after removal of all four manganese ions from subchloroplast PSII preparations, an effective reactivation of electron transfer14,15,17–20 and oxygen evolution18,22,23 was observed only if a nearly stoichiometric amount of MnII (2–4 atoms of MnII per PSII reaction center) was added together with bicarbonate.
Bicarbonate also specifically restores electron transport on the donor side of PSII containing Mn-sufficient, intact, WOC that has been modified with formate14–18 or by removal of bicarbonate from the medium.14,15,17–21
From comparison of the light-induced FT-IR spectra originating from the donor side of O2-evolving PS II and measured in the presence of (12C)NaHCO3 or (13C) NaHCO321 with the FT-IR spectrum ascribed to the S1/S2 – transition24 it has been postulated that bicarbonate acts as a bridging ligand between the redox-active Mn and Ca2+ within the WOC.21
It has been shown25 that formate modifies the S1-state of the WOC by reduction to the S0-state.
All these facts suggest that HCO3− ion not only involved in the PS II acceptor side, but is also a necessary component for optimal functioning of the WOC.
Although it is chemically reasonable and consistent with available data to suggest that bicarbonate binds as a ligand to either Mn or Ca, we do not yet know where HCO3− binds within the WOC, nor how it functions.
Recent X-ray diffraction data at 3.5 Å resolution of a PSII complex isolated from a cyanobacterium have postulated26 suitable binding sites for (bi)carbonate on both the acceptor and donor sides of PSII.
The authors have suggested (in accordance with an earlier assumption)21 that on the donor side (bi)carbonate binds to the high affinity Mn site and also to Ca based on the absence of sufficient protein ligands,26 though they have no direct support of this.
It was shown in a previous work27 that upon addition of NaHCO3 to an aqueous solution of MnII the potential for oxidation of MnII to MnIII was shifted from 1.19 to 0.63 V at fixed pH 8.3 as a result of formation of (bi)carbonate complexes.
These data provided a basis for suggesting a role for bicarbonate in promoting oxidation of Mn in the WOC.
However, there is contradictory information in the literature about the chemical composition of Mn-bicarbonate complexes in solution.
Lesht and Bauman reported a stability constant for [MnII(HCO3−)]+ (K1 = 18.6 at 298 K) using a thermodynamic method.28
Smith and Martel summarized literature data for K1 equal to 63 and 2.8 at ionic strengths of solutions equal to 3.0 and 0.0 (298 K), respectively.29
Sychev and co-workers30,31 summarized the prior literature and proposed successive formation of [MnII(HCO3−)]+ and MnII(HCO3−)2 complexes and reported their stability constants (K1 = 11 and K2 = 3.7) using an indirect assay method based solely on the HCO3− concentration dependence of the rate of Mn-dependent dismutation of exogenous hydrogen peroxide (at pH 7.0).
Using the same assay method, Stadtman et al. confirmed that HCO3− is required for catalytic dismutation of H2O2 by MnII and showed that three equivalents of HCO3− are required to create the catalyst that is active in the dismutation reaction that forms O2 and water.32
The values of the stability constants for the bicarbonate complexes with MnIII and MnIV and their composition are not known, presumably owing to their instability.
It is clear that more detailed knowledge of the complexation of MnII and MnIII with bicarbonate is required for understanding the thermodynamics consequences.
The aim of the present work is to determine the electrochemical potentials for the oxidation of Mn-complexes of bicarbonate, acetate and formate and correlate them with their capability to donate electrons to Mn-depleted PSII (apo-WOC-PSII).
Subchloroplast membrane fragments enriched in PSII (BBY-particles) and containing 200–220 chlorophyll molecules per PSII reaction center were prepared from pea (Pisum sativum L.) chloroplasts, as described previously.33
A complete (>95%) removal of Mn from the membrane fragments was carried out using the treatment with 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) plus 0.5 M MgCl2.34
The preparations were stored in liquid nitrogen or at −80 °C at a Chl concentration of 2 mg ml−1 after the addition of 10% glycerol.
A partial removal of bicarbonate from BBY preparations was achieved, as described earlier14 by a 200-fold dilution of concentrated (2 mg ml−1) PSII preparations into the medium (100 mM MES-NaOH buffer, pH 6.2, 35 mM NaCl) depleted of endogenous bicarbonate by means of 60 min flushing with air (which was freed from CO2 by passage through a solution of 50% NaOH and 20 cm layer of ascarite) and subsequent 10-min incubation at 20 °C.
The kinetics of the photoinduced change of chlorophyll fluorescence yield (ΔF) (λ > 660 nm) related to photoreduction of the primary quinone electron acceptor of PSII, QA, were measured in a tightly closed 10-mm cuvette at 20 °C using a phosphoroscopic set-up.34
Voltammetry curves for MnII oxidation were recorded with a standard potentiostat (polarographic analyzer model PA-3; LP, Praha) using a three-electrode cell, as described earlier.27
A hemispheric Pt electrode with visible surface of 0.01 cm2, and soldered in glass, was used as the working electrode.
A Pt plate (1 × 1 cm) was used as counter-electrode.
All potentials were measured against the saturated calomel electrode and then were recalculated versus the normal hydrogen electrode.
The accuracy of the potential measurements was equal to 10 mV.
A solution of 0.1 M LiClO4 in water was used as the background.
Oxygen was not removed during the measurements.
Adsorption of the oxidized products accompanied by the appearance of a new anodic wave at 0.68 V (that increased with the number of scans), was a characteristic feature of the measurements of MnII oxidation curves.
Therefore, recordings of the voltage–current curves for MnII on Pt were carried out only upon the first scan.
The Pt working electrode was cleaned with filter paper after each scanning into the anodic region.
Reagent grade NaHCO3, NaHCO2, CH3COONa and LiClO4 were used in this work using doubly-distilled water with initial pH 6.5.
Addition of acetate (NaCH3COO), formate (NaHCO2) or oxalate (Na2(COO)2) to water led to gradual alkalization of the solution up to pH 8.5.
Dissolving of bicarbonate (NaHCO3) in the range of concentrations used in this study produces solutions having a constant pH equal to pH 8.3.
Accordingly, the dominant species in solution is the bicarbonate anion (pKa1 = 6.3, pKa2 = 10.3).
Control measurements to examine the influence of pH were performed with MnSO4 in unbuffered water by addition of HCl or KOH.
The potential–current curves for oxidation of MnII were found to be independent of pH in the 5.0 to 8.5 range (less than 10 mV change for the whole region).
However, above pH 9 the oxidation potential begins to shift due to complex formation with hydroxide.
This shift is in agreement with the onset of formation of [Mn(OH)]+ (pKa for Mn2+aq is 10.5).
Therefore, in the present experiments at pH lower than 8.35, Mn2+aq, and not [Mn(OH)]+, is the predominant MnII species detected electrochemically in equilibrium with exogenous anions.
It has been shown earlier that complete removal of Mn from PSII membrane fragments results in a 15–20-fold decrease of the photoinduced changes of chlorophyll fluorescence yield (ΔF) (due to loss of electron transfer from the WOC to PSII reaction centers) that can be restored by Mn2+ added at a catalytic (0.1–0.2 μM) concentration.34
The capability of added Mn2+ to restore photoinduced ΔF in Mn-depleted PSII preparations considerably increases upon the addition of bicarbonate.15,16
Fig. 1 shows that (in accordance with the previous publications) the photoinduced ΔF lost due to removal of Mn from BBY preparations (curve 1) is efficiently reactivated if 0.2 μM MnCl2 (which corresponds to 4 Mn atoms per one PSII reaction center) is added together with 5 mM NaHCO3 (curve 4), while 0.2 μM MnCl2 added alone induces a very low reactivation (curve 3).
This activation by bicarbonate in the presence of 0.2 μM MnCl2 (curve 4) saturates at 1–2 mM bicarbonate and 50% saturation occurs at 100–200 μM NaHCO3 (data not shown).
By contrast, formate does not facilitate the restoration of ΔF (curve 5); on the other hand, bicarbonate added to the sample containing 0.2 μM MnCl2 and 5 mM formate causes a considerable restoration of ΔF (curve 6), similar to that observed upon the addition of bicarbonate in the absence of formate (curve 4).
Similar effects are seen for acetate: no reactivation of ΔF upon its addition together with MnCl2 (curve 7) and subsequent reactivation with bicarbonate (curve 8).
The effects are shown for 5 mM concentration of formate and acetate but they are similar over a wide range of concentrations (10 μM–10 mM) of these carboxylates.
The formation of MnIII complexes with different ligands was measured under electrochemical oxidation of MnII to MnIII.
If the electrode reaction is reversible, and the amount of a ligand is so great that its concentration near the surface of the electrode is equal to that in bulk solution, then recording the dependence of the oxidation potential on the logarithm of concentration of the ligand [eqn.
(I)], it is possible to determine the composition of the complex and the equilibrium stability constant for reaction:35,36 MnII − e + pX− ⇔ MnIIIXpwhere E1/2me and E1/2com are the half-wave oxidation potentials for MnII and its complex with ligand X, respectively; Kst is the stability constant of the complex; CX is the concentration of ligand X in solution, q and p is the number of ligands in complexes of MnII and MnIII, respectively; n is the number of electrons involved in the redox reaction.
In the case of prior complex formation with MnII the oxidation process is: MnII Xq − e + (p − q) X− ⇔ MnIIIXp.
In this case, the shift of the oxidation potential of MnII depends on the ratio of the stability constants for oxidized (Kox) and the reduced (Kred) forms, as well as on the concentration of the ligand as given by eqn. (II):35,36
In both cases, the number of ligands in the complex can be determined from the slope of the dependence of the oxidation potential on log CX.
By extrapolation of the curve to log CX = 0, the standard reduction potential E0 of the complex and its stability constant can be determined:
The voltage–current curves obtained by voltammetry method on the Pt-electrode are seen as a wave with a peak characterized by the value of the peak potential, Ep.
For reversible one- or two-electron processes, the difference between Ep and E1/2 is equal to 28 and 14 mV, respectively.37
We used the experimental Ep values instead of E1/2 for plotting of eqns. (1) and (2).
The first stage of MnII oxidation in acidic (pH < 1) solutions is a reversible reaction given by eqn. (1):MnII(H2O)6 − e− ⇔ MnIII(H2O)6which is characterized by E0 = 1.51 V.38,39
Since the hydrolysis constant (pKa) for MnIII is close to 0, the hydrolysis reaction of MnIII with the formation of [MnIII(OH)2+] takes place at pH > .038
This reaction is followed by further hydrolysis to form Mn2O3(aq) which is a precursor to forming the insoluble solid, Mn2O3(s), as summarized in the following equations:2MnII − 2e− + 2H2O ⇔ 2MnIII(OH)2+ + 2H+2MnIII(OH)2+ + 2H2O ⇒ MnIV(OH)4 + MnII + 2H+MnII + MnIV(OH)4 ⇒ MnIIMnIVO3 + H2O + 2H+2MnII − 2e− + 3H2O ⇒ MnIIMnIVO3 + 6H+
Due to these hydrolysis reactions the wave for MnII oxidation at pH > 0 in the absence of ligands corresponds increasingly to eqns. (1)–(5).
The hydrolysis reactions are responsible for the irreversibility of reactions (2)–(4).
However, in the presence of ligands (X) that bind to MnIII more strongly than water the hydrolysis reactions of MnIII are suppressed.
Therefore, in the presence of the ligands, oxidation of MnII occurs in accordance with reaction (1).
The potential for oxidation is no longer equal to 1.51 V, but shifts to lower potentials.
Fig. 2 shows the cyclic voltage–current curve of MnSO4 (5 × 10−4 M) oxidation (curve 1) on the background of 0.1 M LiClO4 in water (curve 0).
The oxidation wave of MnII aqua-cations with the maximum at 1.18 V is clearly seen on the anode branch of the curve (in good agreement with previous measurements of the potential of MnII oxidation in water solutions).27
A small cathode wave at 1.12 V and additional two peaks at 0.96 and 0.28 V are observed upon the return scan, reflecting the presence of all the reactions, e.g., (1–5) of MnII oxidation in water.
The anode peak of MnII oxidation is shifted to lower potentials (0.82 instead of 1.18 V) upon the addition of ca.
100 mM acetate, and the cathode peaks at 0.76 V and at 0.59 V are observed upon the return scan in this case.
The difference between the anode (Epa) and the first cathode (Epk) peaks for MnII is equal to 60 mV, both in the presence and absence of acetate thus indicating a reversible transfer of one electron per MnII during the oxidation step.
The peak current of the cathode peak is much lower than the anode peak current, which indicates that a subsequent transformation of the oxidation product into another product takes place.
This oxidation product (the peak at 0.59 V) is attributed to the disproportionation reaction eqn. (3).
The same picture is observed in the case of formate, oxalate and bicarbonate complexes of MnIII (not shown).
The reversibility of the electron transfer was further confirmed by the data on independence of the peak potential difference between Epa and Epk on the scan rate in the region from 10 mV s−1 to 50 mV s−1.
These considerations allow us to consider the MnII oxidation process in the presence of ligands as reversible and thus we used eqns. (I) or (II) to determine the composition, the stability constant and standard potential E0 for the complexes from the dependence of Ep on log CX taking into account that for the free aqua complex of MnII, E0me = 1.51 V.38
Since the value of the stability constants is well known for MnII-oxalate and MnIII-oxalate complexes,40 we started first by considering the effects of the oxalate (Ox2−) on the oxidation of MnII in order to check the validity of using eqns. (I) and (II) to estimate these values.
Upon addition of sodium oxalate the wave of MnaqII oxidation (1.18 V in 0.1 M LiClO4) is shifted to negative potentials.
In the concentration region from 2.15 × 10−3 M to 7.11 × 10−3 M (Fig. 3, curve 1) the dependence of the peak potential on log CX is linear and the slope of this dependence (ΔE/Δlog CX) is equal to 58 mV, indicating participation of just one ligand in the electrode reaction:MnII− e− + Ox2− ⇔ [MnIII(Ox2−)]+.Extrapolation of this linear part of the dependence to log CX = 0 gives the value for E0, equal to 0.92 V. Using eqn. (I), the logarithm of the stability constant of the MnIII-oxalate complex is equal to 10 ± 0.01 which is in agreement with the literature data for log Kst of [MnIII(C2O42−)]+ equal to 9..9840
At oxalate concentrations above 7.11 × 10−3 M, a new linear section with a slope of 126 mV is observed (Fig. 3, curve 1) that reveals an additional electrode process.
The slope of this section reveals participation of two ligands in the electrode reaction.
Extrapolation of the linear dependence of Ep to log CX = 0 gives the E0 value equal to 0.77 V. The same value is obtained using eqn. (II) and in the available literature data, as follows.
The dissociation constant of Mn complexes with Ox2− are 1.5 × 10−4 for MnII(Ox2−) and 2.72 × 10−17 for MnIII[(Ox2−)2]−.40
Then the logarithm of Kox/Kred will be equal to 12.75 that [according to eqn. (II)] gives ΔE0 equal to 0.75 V and E0com equal to 0.76 V. This (calculated) value agrees with the value of E0 obtained from our experimental work (0.77 V).
We conclude that the electrode reaction consists in this case of two steps:MnII + Ox2− ⇔ MnII(Ox2−)MnII(Ox2−) − e− + Ox2− ⇔ [MnIII(Ox2−)2]−The agreement with the literature data, as well as the strict linear dependence of EP on log CX, demonstrates the accuracy of our measurements and confirms the suitability of using the eqns. (I) and (II).
Upon the addition of acetate ions (Fig. 2, curve 2), the oxidation peak is also shifted to lower potentials.
A linear dependence of the potential versus the logarithm of CH3COONa concentration is observed over the whole range of acetate concentration from 1 × 10−3 M to 0.15 M (Fig. 3, curve 2).
The slope is equal to 120 mV which by eqn. (I), gives p = 2 for n = 1 and thus corresponds to a 1∶2 ratio of Mn∶acetate, formulated as [MnIII(CH3COO−)2]+:MnII − e− + 2CH3COO− → [MnIII(CH3COO−)2]+.Extrapolation of the potential dependence to log CX = 0 gives E0 = 0.69 V for this process and enables calculation of the stability constant for acetate binding, Kst = 7.91 × 1013 at T = 21.5 °C.
Essentially identical behaviour is seen for oxidation of MnII in the presence of formate.
In this case, the shift of EP is characterized by a linear dependence on the logarithm of the formate concentration between 3 × 10−3 and 1.6 × 10−1 M, as shown in Fig. 3 (curve 3).
The slope is equal to 131 ± 5 mV, which according to eqn. (I) gives p ≅ 2 at n = 1, corresponding to a reaction stoichiometry of 1∶2:MnII − e− + 2HCO2− → [MnIII(HCO2−)2]+.Extrapolation of the data to log CX = 0 gives E0 = 0.775 V for MnIII(HCO2−)2+ and a corresponding stability constant Kst equal to 2.86 × 1012.
A different behaviour is seen for the dependence of the voltage–current curves for MnII oxidation in the presence of NaHCO3 (Fig. 4).
At first (at concentration of NaHCO3 higher than 6 × 10−3 M) the peak of MnII oxidation is shifted to lower potentials (Fig. 4, curves 2–4), which is analogous to the data obtained with acetate and formate.
However, at NaHCO3 concentrations higher than 2 × 10−2 M a new MnII oxidation wave appears around 0.70 V. It begins to emerge as a shoulder above 3 × 10−2 M and becomes the only peak observed at bicarbonate concentration of 8.3 × 10−2 M (Fig. 4, curves 4–8).
Upon further increase of NaHCO3 (0.1 M and higher) the shift of the oxidation potential of MnII is still observed, however, the height of the oxidation wave begins to decrease progressively due to the precipitation of a white suspension of MnCO3.
Fig. 3 (curves 4 and 5) shows the dependence of the MnII oxidation potential on the logarithm of bicarbonate (BC) concentration.
The dependence reveals three linear components with different slopes reflecting participation of as many as three precursors in the oxidation.
We discuss these in sequence.
(i) The linear dependence of the MnII oxidation potential on log CX at concentration higher than 3 × 10−3 M, NaHCO3 (Fig. 3, curve 4) reflects the oxidation of free aqua MnII (in analogy with the other anions) since it extrapolates back to the free MnII potential.
The slope of this dependence is equal to 173 ± 5 mV, in contrast to the slope for oxalate, acetate and formate, and thus by eqn. (I) corresponds most closely to p ≅ 3 for n = 1.
This ratio suggests participation of three HCO3− anions in this electrode reaction:MnII − e− + 3HCO3− ⇔ MnIII(HCO3−)3E0 is equal to 0.67 V for this reaction (determined by extrapolation to log C = 0).
This value gives a stability constant for MnIII(HCO3−)3Kst = 1.73 × 1014 [T = 21 °C].
It is clearly seen (Fig. 3, curve 4) that the plot of the dependence of MnII oxidation potential on log CX is free of any breaks, thus indicating that a single species is detected, formulated as the electro-neutral species MnIII(HCO3−)3.
(ii) The voltage–current curves in Fig. 4 show that a second precursor is revealed (as a “new” wave of oxidation) at increasing bicarbonate concentrations that is more easily oxidized (appears at less positive potential) than the previous species.
The experimental dependence of the oxidation potential of this new wave on log CX (from −1.4 to −1.08) reveals a linear region with slope equal to 60 ± 2 mV (Fig. 3, curve 5), suggesting the involvement of one additional bicarbonate ion per electron in the oxidation of this new complex.
Extrapolation of the data in Fig. 3 (curve 5) to log CX = 0 gives the E0 = 0.61 V (complex I).
(iii) Upon further increase of the NaHCO3 concentration (to 0.1 M and higher) there is a break in the dependence of EP on log CX (Fig. 3, curve 5) with a linear slope equal to 120 ± 10 mV, suggesting the involvement of two additional bicarbonate ions per electron in the oxidation of this new complex.
In this case, the slope extrapolates to E0 = 0.52 V at log CX = 0.
The appearance of this new section is evidently related to oxidation of another MnII-BC complex (complex II).
Analysis of the dependence of oxidation EP on log CX for both MnII-BC complexes (using eqn. (II)) is complicated since it requires knowledge of the stability constants of the initial MnII complexes.
In the literature the values represented for the stability constant, Kst, of complex MnII(HCO3−)+ are different: 18628. and 63..129
Sychev et al30,31. reported the formation of two complexes, MnII(HCO3−)+ and MnII(HCO3−)2 having stability constants equal to 11 and 40.7, respectively.
This considerable uncertainty in the values of Kst requires further work.
A similar dependence of EP on log CX is observed, if the titration is performed at a constant concentration of bicarbonate while changing the MnII concentration (Fig. 5).
In this case at fixed bicarbonate concentration, the wave associated with complexes I and II appears first followed by formation of the MnaqII oxidation wave at higher MnII concentration, e.g., in reverse sequence to that observed in Fig 4.
After recording the background curve (Fig. 5, curve 0), 0.05 M NaHCO3 was added and the background in the presence of NaHCO3 was again measured (curve 01).
The titration shows the step-by-step addition of MnSO4 (from 55 μM to 1 mM).
Under these experimental conditions, the wave of the most stable Mn–bicarbonate complex at EP = 0.56 V appears first (curve 1).
The amplitude of this wave is linearly increased upon the increase of the MnII concentration.
Analysis of the EP shift for curves 1–6 yields a linear slope ΔE/Δlog CMn of 120 mV, followed by (curves 7–9) a shallower slope, ΔE/Δlog CMn approximately equal to ca.
60 mV.
At this concentration, one sees that a new current wave also appears at a potential of ca.
0.9 V. This peak shifts to more positive potentials with increasing concentrations of MnII (curves 7–12) with a slope ΔE/Δlog C equal to 180 mV.
In this region (curves 7–12) MnagII is oxidized by the reaction:MnII − e− + 3HCO3− ⇒ MnIII(HCO3−)3.The observed equilibria are the same as found in Fig. 4.
The data presented herein show that only bicarbonate but not carboxylate ligands (acetate, formate) is capable of stimulating the photooxidation rate of MnaqII by Mn-depleted apo-WOC-PSII.
This stimulation occurs using MnII concentrations equal to the native stoichiometry of 4 Mn/PSII and over a 1000-fold range in ligand concentrations.
The electrochemical characteristics of MnII oxidation offer a possible explanation for the stimulation of the photooxidation rate and its selectivity for bicarbonate.
The oxidation potential for MnIII/MnII decreases from 1.18 V for MnaqII (in 0.1 M LiClO4, pH independent in the region pH 5.0–pH 8.5) to less positive values upon formation of MnIII complexes with acetate, formate, oxalate and bicarbonate, respectively:MnII − e− + 2CH3COO− ⇔ [MnIII(CH3COO−)2]+E0 = 0.69 V, (Kst = 7.9 × 1013)MnII − e− + 2HCO2− ⇔ [MnIII(HCO2−)2]+E0 = 0.775 V, (Kst = 2.9 × 1012)MnII − e− + Ox2− ⇔ [MnIII(Ox2−)]+E0 = 0.92 V, (Kst = 1.0 × 1010)MnII − e− + 3HCO3− ⇔ MnIII(HCO3−)3E0 = 0.67 V, (Kst = 1.7 × 1014)In the bicarbonate stimulated oxidation process the stoichiometry of 3 bicarbonates reflects the total number of bicarbonate molecules involved in the process and thus includes several potential MnIII species differing in both ligation and deprotonation of bicarbonate and hydroxide.
Only bicarbonate exhibits two additional electrochemical processes corresponding to two more easily oxidizable MnII-BC complexes (denoted complexes I and II):MnII − BCcomplex I − e− + HCO3− ⇔ MnIII(HCO3−)3E0 = 0.61 VMnII − BCcomplex II − e− + 2HCO3− ⇔ MnIII(HCO3−)3E0 = 0.52 VThe formation of these MnII complexes with bicarbonate results in a maximum decrease of the oxidation potential of MnII that is probably important for their redox interaction with apo-WOC-PSII.
These complexes form at bicarbonate concentrations above 0.025 M, which is close to the upper concentration region, we could explore, owing to the onset of precipitation of MnCO3 at 0.1 M. It is possible that these MnII–BC complexes represent oligomeric Mnn(BC)m clusters.
However, the instability of the solutions to precipitation did not allow a wider study of the dependence on Mn and bicarbonate concentrations.
In case of acetate and formate, a positively charged complex, MnIIIL2, forms upon oxidation of MnaqII.
Only for bicarbonate does the neutral complex MnIII(HCO3−)3 form upon oxidation of MnaqII..
The absence of breaks in the plot of EPvs. log of the concentration of acetate and formate shows that, in spite of the possibility of formation of MnII-complexes with the added ligands (log Kst for the MnII–(CH3COO−)+ is equal to 1.2),40 there is no additional wave related to the oxidation of the MnIIL complexes.
These results suggest that these complexes are either not electroactive or are not stable in solution at the surface of the positively charged electrode.
For MnII-complexes with acetate, formate and bicarbonate the value of the stability constant is known to be ca.
101–102.27,28,40
The large difference in the stability constants for MnIIvs. MnIII complexes is a clear indicator of large differences in the kinetics of binding/dissociation and thus will be of importance for understanding the dynamics of Mn photooxidation by the WOC.
This difference may explain the considerable variations in the bicarbonate concentration (from μM to mM) measured for optimal reconstitution of electron transfer rates from MnII to apo-WOC-PSII.14–22
These variations could reflect changes in the average oxidation state of manganese ions as they assemble to form the Mn4 cluster or upon the S-state transitions of the WOC.
The electrochemical data allow us to answer why the YZ˙ radical in PSII is capable of oxidizing MnII.
The E0 value for MnaqII is equal to 1.18 V, which is higher than the oxidation potential of the YZ˙ radical estimated to 0.95–1.0 V.41
We may conclude that MnII can be efficiently oxidized by YZ˙ only in the presence of ligands capable of shifting the MnII oxidation potential to a lower value and thus stabilizing the MnIII oxidation state.
Nevertheless, the effect of these anions on electron transfer from MnII to apo-WOC-PSII is quite different.
Acetate and formate are not active in stimulation of electron transfer from MnII to apo-WOC-PSII, although both anions considerably lower the reduction potential of MnIII/MnII.
Bicarbonate efficiently stimulates the process of MnII-dependent electron transfer to apo-WOC-PSII, and is also known to reverse the formate-induced inhibition of electron transport from MnII and O2 evolution of functionally active PSII with high specificity.14–18
Thus, bicarbonate is special and presumably binds together with MnII to apo-WOC-PSII forming a ternary complex that is capable of efficient photooxidation of additional MnII.
This ternary complex may form starting either with MnaqII or the MnII-BC complexes I and II as precursors.
However, the current results have not identified which one or all of these precursors is involved, nor the structure of these complexes.
One may consider the following differences as possible reasons for the advantage of bicarbonate vs. carboxylate anions in stimulating the photooxidation rate of MnII by apo-WOC-PSII:
(i) Only bicarbonate forms an electro-neutral complex MnIII(HCO3−)3, while the other ligands form charged complexes: [MnIII(HCO2−)2]+, [MnIII(CH3COO−)2]+.
Net charge exerts influence on the local concentration of the MnII precursor near PSII.42
(ii) Since photooxidation of MnII with YZ˙ in apo-WOC-PSII releases a proton on the first and subsequent steps,42,43 ligands such as acetate, formate or oxalate, which have a low pK 2–4, may not be suitable for exchanging H+ with the medium at pH 6.5 (used in the PSII experiments), versus the higher proton affinity of bicarbonate (pKa = 6.4).
Bicarbonate is also amphoteric having both acidic and basic properties (carbonate pKa = 10.3).
(iii) On the basis of our electrochemical results, the bicarbonate stoichiometry is 3 for the formation of the MnIII-bicarbonate complex.
The high Lewis acidity of MnIII (pKa ≈ 1)39 requires that MnIII(HCO3−)3 will ionize one or more HCO3− ligands to form MnIII(HCO3−)2(OH−)1 + CO2 or MnIII(HCO3−)(CO32−) + CO2 at pH 8.3 used in the present studies.
Formation of these complexes may stimulate both the kinetics of incorporation of MnII into the apo-WOC and the subsequent assembly of other MnII ions during reconstitution of the Mn4Ox core of the WOC.
Thermodynamic data also confirm this proposal.
The energy required to dissociate OH− from bicarbonate is considerably smaller (8.9 kcal mol−1) than the energy for dissociation of OH− from water (21.4 kcal mol−1).44
(iv) The maximum decrease of the potential of MnII oxidation (down to 0.52 V) is observed for MnII–BC complex II, which forms at the highest bicarbonate concentration studied (>0.1 M).
We previously suggested that MnII–BC complexes were similar to the major MnII species in the oceans of the Archean period (>2.2 BYA), where estimates of the bicarbonate concentration are considerably higher than for the contemporary ocean (10–104 mM).44
The electrochemical potentials of MnII–BC complexes I and II (0.61 and 0.52 V) indicate that they are thermodynamically capable of serving as electron donors to reaction centers of both green and purple photoautotrophic bacteria (E0 ∼ 0.26–0.55 V).45
Recently, it has been shown that Mn–bicarbonate complexes can serve as electron donor to bacterial reaction centers genetically modified to shift the redox potential of the primary electron donor to more positive potentials46.
Multiple labelled nanoparticles for bio detection
Remote nanoparticle detection is required for the development of in situ biological probes.
Here we describe the labelling of silver nanoparticles to produce multiply coded particles which can be detected by surface enhanced resonance Raman scattering (SERRS).
There is a potential for thousands of codes to be written and read without the need for spatial resolution of components of the code.
The use of these systems in bioanlaysis and in situ detection is discussed.
The use of nanoparticles for in situ detection of specific reactions has significant potential to probe living cells and tissues.
For example, the detection in a cell of DNA or protein/receptor interactions will provide information of specific functionality.
Fluorescence is a possible detection technology since it is both sensitive and selective and is already widely used for biological analysis.
However, one form of Raman spectroscopy, surface enhanced resonance Raman scattering (SERRS), has superior properties for labelling of nanoparticles.
Both techniques have similar sensitivities1 but with SERRS many more codes can be written onto the surface of the nanoparticles than is the case with fluorescence.
In addition, since both fluorophores and non fluorophores are suitable a more robust, extensive and simpler labelling chemistry can be used.2,3
Raman scattering has many advantages in biological systems in that it provides a vibrational spectrum from aqueous solutions using visible wavelength lasers and detectors.
It involves the irradiation of a sample with a laser and the measurement of components of light scattered from the target system, which are displaced in frequency by one vibrational unit.
The pattern of signals is often diagnostic or is characteristic of a particular molecule or group, enabling in situ detection, particularly if the analyte signal is enhanced over the background.
Water provides very poor Raman scattering and consequently is nearly transparent making the technique useful in bioanalysis.
However, there are two big disadvantages, namely that Raman scattering is weak with only 1 in about 108 scattered photons being Raman scattered and fluorescence from the sample matrix can often swamp the Raman signal.
Enhancement of Raman scattering can be obtained in a number of ways.
Among the most effective is SERRS in which the analyte molecule is adsorbed onto a suitable roughened surface such as that of silver or gold nanoparticles and an excitation frequency close to the plasmon frequency of the particles is used.4–7
The plasmon frequency is often shifted by aggregation of the particles.
The enhancement can be increased further by using an analyte which is a dye for which one of the absorption peaks lies in a frequency region reasonably close to the excitation frequency8,9 (within 50–100 nm).
SERRS enhancement of the Raman signal of up to 1014 has been claimed and single molecule detection has been demonstrated.10,11
In addition to the sensitivity, one of the major improvements of SERRS over existing technologies is that the Raman signals obtained are sharp and can be interpreted easily in terms of the resonance spectrum of the analyte.
The narrow signals can be more easily resolved than those of fluorescence and the signal pattern is molecularly specific.
Thus, individual dyes can be clearly discriminated in mixtures and this opens up the potential for the coding of nanoparticles with multiple labels in a manner which enables them to be identified in situ in a flowing stream or in a biological matrix.
In this paper, the ability to label silver nanoparticles with a number of dyes and with an oligonucleotide suitable for DNA hybridization and hence DNA labeling is demonstrated.
For a dye to be an effective label for reproducible SERRS it must bind strongly to the surface even in the biological environment.
A number of dyes using different types of metal complexing are used and investigated to see if they can simultaneously bind to the nanoparticles or if dyes with one type of complexing group dominate.
The possible future application of these functionalised nanoparticles is investigated by attaching a dye labeled oligonucleotide to create a SERRS active analyte and examining the stability in buffer.
These experiments are carried out in suspensions of the colloidal nanoparticles and it is difficult to assess whether all single particles are multiple labeled in the same way.
We do, however achieve this on a single micro bead which can be optically detected.
All spectra were acquired using a Renishaw 2000 Raman Microprobe with a triple stage Peltier cooled CCD detector.
The excitation was provided by a Spectra-Physics Model 2020 argon-ion laser with a wavelength of 514.5 nm and 3 mW of power at the source.
Samples were analysed in a plastic microtitre plate using a ×50 objective.
The acquisition time for all spectra was 10 s and the grating was centered at 1350 cm−1.
The concentration study was carried out on a Renishaw inVia system with a CCD spectrometer.
The excitation was provided by a Spectra-Physics argon-ion laser with a wavelength of 514.5 nm and 10 mW of power at the source.
The citrate reduced silver nanoparticle suspension used in this work was prepared by a modified Lee and Meisel method.12,13
An aggregating agent is commonly added to the colloid to induce the formation of small clusters, whose surface plasmon matches the frequency of the excitation source.
The aggregating agent used was either a 1 M sodium chloride solution or a 0.01 M spermine solution.
Spermine was used for all experiments involving the labelled oligonucleotide since as well as being an effective aggregating agent for silver colloid,14 it is a known charge neutralisation agent for the negatively charge phosphate backbone of DNA,15 aiding adsorption of the sample to the metal surface.
For each sample 250 μL of nanoparticle suspension, 250 μL of distilled water, 30 μL of each analyte and 10 μL of aggregating agent were mixed together and the SERRS was immediately acquired.
The oligonucleotide examined contained a basic priming sequence of 5′ GTG CTG CAG GTG TAA ACT TGT ACC AG 3′.
The visible chromophore used was the fluorophore 2,5,2′,4′,5′,7′-hexachloro-6-carboxyfluorescein (HEX), which was attached at the 5′ terminus.
HEX is negatively charged and therefore repels the negatively charged metal surface.
Surface attachment was achieved by the incorporation of positively charged modified nucleobases at the 5′-terminus next to the HEX label.16
Rhodamine dye was purchased from Aldrich and all other dyes used were synthesised in our Raman group.
SERRS can be used for labelling both fluorophores and non fluorophores.
Fluorescence quenching from a dye efficiently adsorbed on the surface is very effective so that the dye is clearly and easily recognised.
Thus, rhodamine 6G, a standard fluorophore, shows excellent Raman scattering with a very high degree of sensitivity.
This dye has been widely used in the development of SERRS spectroscopy.
However, when we attempted to use it in biological media, fluorescence which obscured the Raman scattering was obtained from the silver particle suspensions.
It would appear that rhodamine does not adhere strongly to surfaces and can be easily displaced by biological media such as buffer.
To overcome this problem we have used dyes which have a specific attachment chemistry to the surface.
We have recently published a number of papers on some of these and related dyes showing that they are effective in displacing ligands from the surface and in giving excellent SERRS.
However we also use a new dye here which is discussed later.
To test the sensitivity of the assay, a concentration study was carried out using 3,5-dimethoxy-4-(6′-azobenzotriazolyl)-phenylamine, to discover the minimum amount that could be detected by SERRS.
Fig. 1 shows a plot of SERRS intensity against concentration for this dye.
The acquisition time used was 0.5 s for all measurements.
The intensity of the peak at 1367 cm−1, after the background had been subtracted, was measured for each spectrum.
For each concentration, five consecutive measurements were made and the average number of counts in this peak determined.
The dye was detectable down to a concentration of the order of 10−10 M, calculated as the final concentration that would have been present in solution before adsorption of the dye to the metal surface.
The concentration versus intensity plot is almost linear, apart from the highest concentration.
By calculation of the surface area present and approximating the area each dye molecule occupies, the approximate concentration at which monolayer coverage occurs can be worked out as about 10−6 M. Thus the highest concentration shown is above monolayer coverage.
Since SERRS intensity drops off rapidly with distance from the surface, the levelling of the graph is to be expected.
Previous papers have commented on the fact that there is a change in slope approximately at one tenth of surface coverage, i.e. at about 10−7 M. This dye can affect the charge on the particles and thus above one tenth of monolayer coverage both the state of aggregation and also packing effects can play a role.
However compared to the effect of complete coverage of the surface, Fig. 1 shows that the effect of this is minor.
At 10−10 M, there are about 1000 molecules in the beam with the objective used.
This is not a detection limit, since a longer accumulation time or more laser power would greatly improve the sensitivity.
However, the focus here is not on single molecule detection but on multiple labelling so this was not pursued.
We have already shown single molecule detection elsewhere.16
The experiment was carried out using 514 nm excitation and sodium chloride to aggregate the colloid.
The sodium chloride treatment induces the formation of small clusters which remain in suspension, and whose plasmon is shifted from the frequency of the single particle (406 nm) to higher wavelengths.
Since the clusters formed have a variety of shapes and sizes, and therefore different plasmon frequencies, not all clusters are resonant with 514 nm excitation.
Consequently only a few percent at most of the dye is actually surface and resonance enhanced.
Although an aggregating agent has been employed, we have shown that the dye used in this concentration study actually induces aggregation itself.
To investigate single particle enhancement, similar experiments were carried out using no aggregating agent and a non aggregating dye in which the amine group is replaced by a hydroxyl group.
This ensures that on adsorption of the ligand, the negative charge on the particle is maintained and hence no aggregation occurs.
This was checked using a Malvern particle size analyser.
The single particle enhancement is not as large as with aggregates.
When an excitation frequency of 406 nm, corresponding to the frequency of the unaggregated plasmon, was used, the enhancement was approximately one sixth of that obtained with an aggregating agent at 514 nm.
Thus, eventually in biological use two different approaches are possible.
Single particles can be used directly with some drop in sensitivity, or a specific way can be found to make selected clusters of one particular size and plasmon resonance.
To indicate the advantage of SERRS in selective labelling, a set of three dyes was selected from those available in the laboratory.
The first dye was rhodamine 6G, a standard fluorophore, which attaches to the silver by electrostatic attraction through the positive charge on the dye and the negative charge on the citrate reduced silver.
The second dye was 3,5-dimethoxy-4-(6′-azobenzotriazolyl)-phenylamine, which was used in the sensitivity study.
This dye uses the benzotriazole group to complex strongly to the silver.
We have shown previously that benzotriazole can displace a citrate layer from the surface to form a thermodynamically more stable layer.
We have already shown that in practice, rhodamine will be unsuitable.
Correctly attached to the silver the fluorescence is completely quenched but displacement is easy and the fluorescence from even a small amount of the dye prevents effective SERRS measurement.
Therefore we have begun to explore other mechanisms of binding than the use of benzotriazole to ensure that a wide range of labels with good surface attachment can be synthesised.
The third dye was 4 pyridine azo.
Pyridine was the first molecule to exhibit surface-enhanced Raman scattering through adsorption at a metal surface.4
However since the new dye has the nitrogen at either end of the molecule it complexes to form a linear chain with silver(i).
It is believed that it will self assemble on the silver surface and thus become immobilised.
Fig. 2 shows the spectra obtained with these three dyes.
In this figure, each dye can be identified individually in the dye mixture by the presence of unique marker bands.
By varying the concentration of each dye to alter its relative intensity in the spectrum from the dye mixture, it is possible to write thousands of codes onto the silver colloids without the need for any form of separation.
Thus, with the use of the correct dye set, a system of nanoparticle detection can be constructed in which single nanoparticles can be identified in situ without any extensive preparation or separation.
One way of using the system in biodetection would be to attach the particles to an oligonucleotide containing a chromophore.
We have shown previously that a dye labelled oligonucleotide can be used with standard molecular biology procedures to detect by SERRS the defect in cystic fibrosis genes.17
In essence, the labelled nanoparticle takes the place of a fluorophore in the published assay.
DNA was attached to the nanoparticle surface using a linker and a specific dye molecule, in this case, HEX.
A further three dyes were attached to the metal surface.
Dye 1,1-[4-(8-hydroxy-quinolin-5-ylazo)-phenyl]-ethanone and dye 3, N,N′-bis-quinolin-8-ol-5-ylmethylene-hydrazine, are novel dyes which attach to the metal surface through the 8-hydroxyquinoline complexing group.
Dye 2,1-[4-(7-amino-3H-benzotriazol-4-ylazo)-phenyl-]ethanone complexes through the benzotriazole group.
Fig. 3 shows the spectra acquired from each of the individual dyes, including that with the oligonucleotide attached.
This figure also shows the spectrum recorded from the mixture of all dyes.
The acquisition time for all spectra was 10 s and all have been normalised to have the same maximum intensity in the highest peak in each spectra.
In Fig. 3 dashed lines have been added linking features in the spectrum from the mixture with the spectrum from the pure sample from which they originate.
It is possible to pick out the presence of all the dyes, including the one with the DNA strip attached, by eye, in the spectrum from the dye mixture.
It is clear that the peaks labelled A, B and C are due to the presence of dye 1.
Peak D has contributions from both dye 3 and HEX.
The relative intensity of this peak is higher in the spectrum from the mixture than in either of the individual spectra from HEX or dye 1 showing that the presence of both samples have contributed to this feature.
A shoulder, E*, is visible on peak E. It is likely that E and E* originate from contributions from dye 1 and dye 3 which have peaks at similar positions.
Feature F can be attributed to dye 1 and the peak G, and its shoulder G* look similar to the feature in HEX at that wavenumber.
However, dye 3 also has a peak at the position of peak G. The relative intensity of G* compared to G has decreased in the spectrum from the mixture compared to that of pure HEX, indicating that the contribution from dye 3 has increased the intensity of peak G in the mixture.
In the pure HEX spectrum peak G is less intense than the peak at higher wavenumber.
The difference in intensities between these peaks is not so large in the spectrum from the mixture, providing further evidence for a contribution from dye 3.
Peak H is due to the presence of dye 3 and I can be attributed to dye 2.
Dye 1 also has a peak at the position of peak I. However, examination of the spectrum from dye 1 shows that this peak is less intense than the group of peaks responsible for features A–C in that spectrum.
That group of peaks has a low relative intensity in the spectrum from the mixture, and the peak at 1590 cm−1 will have an even smaller contribution to the spectrum from the mixture.
Therefore peak I will be dominated by the contribution from dye 2 and the effect of dye 1 can be taken to be minor.
Finally, peak J can be assigned to HEX.
Table 1 summarises the marker bands for each dye in the spectrum from the mixture.
The volumes and concentrations of the dyes used in the mixture are also listed in Table 1.
A surprising feature of this experiment which is not fully understood is that the chromophore on the DNA is at least one hundred times more sensitive than that of the other dyes.
In part this is likely to be due to the closeness of the excitation frequency to the HEX chromophore.
Thus, dye labelling, at least in suspension of silver particles containing DNA are practical.
The technique is very sensitive and very selective allowing coding and therefore identification of any one particular suspension.
It is likely that when detecting particles by this method in a biological setting that the oligonucleotide will be in a buffer solution.
To investigate the effect of buffer on the SERRS signal, a suspension containing colloid, water, dyes 1 and 2, HEX and spermine was prepared as previously described, and the SERRS signal was recorded.
A second suspension was then prepared in which the water was replaced by the same volume of saline sodium dihydrogen phosphate buffer, with a pH of 7.
Fig. 4 shows the SERRS signals from the two suspensions.
In the spectrum from the sample with water a peak identifying each dye has been marked.
It is obvious that when water is replaced by buffer a strong SERRS signal can still be obtained.
All dyes are still distinguishable, although their relative intensities in the spectrum have changed.
The buffer contains sodium chloride which is an aggregating agent.
The change in relative intensities may be due to the individual response of each dye to the change in aggregation conditions.
For example, sodium chloride reacts with silver to form a silver chloride layer on the surface of the particles.
This may alter the nature of the surface bonding causing a change in ligand orientation or a change in the relative binding strengths of each ligand to the surface.
However, the dye ratio in the suspension could easily be adjusted so that the signals from all of the dyes were of similar intensities.
To ensure that multiplexed labelling occurred on each individual particle, particles were immobilised on a glass slide by drying out the colloid.
With the optical microscope it is difficult to ensure that signals arrive from a single nanoparticle.
Therefore, somewhat larger particles based on silica polymers were produced by depositing silver on the silica particle surface.
A mixture of two dyes was detected from a single particle.
In another experiment, two dyes and a dye labelled oligonucleotide combination was detected from one μm areas of a cluster of microparticles present on the glass surface.
Further work is in progress to fully characterise the individual nanoparticles.
Particles of this nature have very considerable potential for biochemical analysis and gold particles could be similarly developed.
The advantage of silver is that the range of dyes which remain effective in biological media is much more extensive.
However, there is more difficulty on using silver in viable biological systems such as cell suspensions because silver can react positively with the cell and is well known as a bacteriocide.
Thus, the choice of particle system will depend on the nature of the bioassay to be developed.
Recently, SERRS detection of the cystic fibrosis gene was demonstrated at a level which competes with fluorescence.17
The selectivity of SERRS was used to eliminate a separation step in the assessment of the genetic defect.
However, the detection of one genetic defect provides a detection for only 60% of cystic fibrosis cases.
To achieve over 90% detection, eleven different defects require to be detected.
The new multiple labelled particles provide sufficient coding to make this feasible, for example using the new SERRS/microfluidics methods.18
This type of assay works well with silver and the added sensitivity and more complete development of the silver dye chemistry would make silver the ideal choice in this type of in vitro system.
The difficulty with using silver in in vivo systems such as suspensions of viable cells has meant that the coding systems have not been tested in this type of system.
Here, gold would have a significant advantage but it may be that efficient and complete surface coverage by tightly bound ligands may be sufficient for silver to be used.
If it can be used, the advantages in sensitivity would make it the element of choice for this type of analysis as well.
In either event, SERRS has large advantages in that it provides an unparalleled degree of multiplexing and uses a simpler chemistry than fluorescence.
The importance of being tetrahedral: the cadmium pyramids CdN; N = 4, 10, 20, 35 and 56
Using quasirelativistic density functional theory, we show the surprising stability of the tetrahedral cadmium pyramids Cd4, Cd10, Cd20, Cd35 and Cd56.
While gold clusters AuN, up to N = 13 appear to be planar,1 and those with N up to 19 have low-symmetry three-dimensional structures, Au20 was recently found to be tetrahedral.2
Actually, 20 is one of the “magic numbers” 8, 20, 40, 70 and 112 for electrons in a tetrahedron,3 stabilised by both electronic and atomic shell structure.
For the divalent Group-12 elements Zn and Cd, with two valence electrons per atom, anomalously strong abundance peaks are found for clusters of 6, 10, 18, 20, 28, 30, 32, 35, 40, 41, 46, 54, 57, 60 and 69 atoms.4,5
The peaks for CdN with N = 10, 20 and 35 are very pronounced.
While other than tetrahedral magic numbers occur, we here study the question whether the systems with the tetrahedral magic numbers are actually tetrahedral.
Strong alternative possibilities are amorphous or low-symmetry structures, which, using interatomic model potentials, have been found to be highly favoured by especially Au, Zn and Cd clusters.6–8
In an extensive pair-potential study of Zn and Cd clusters of up to 125 atoms, Doye8 found that only Zn4 and Cd4 possessed tetrahedral symmetry.
All the other potentially tetrahedral pyramids MN; N = 10, 20, 35, 56, 84 and 120, were assigned low or no-symmetry global minima.
As noted by Doye,8 the pair-potential used, being fitted to the bulk metal, is not expected to be optimal for small cluster sizes.
Here we present a reinvestigation of the smallest zinc and cadmium pyramids, using rigorous quantum chemical methodology.
The calculations were performed with the Turbomole program package, version 569. at the density functional theory (DFT) level, using the non-empirical PBE functional.10
We used Turbomole’s standard triple-zeta quality basis sets including an f-polarization function, TZVPP, and the resolution of the identity density-fitting approximation.11
The Stuttgart effective core potential12 modelled the scalar relativistic effects of cadmium.
To study the stability of the pyramids, we first optimised the molecular structures of the species using Td symmetry.
The structures of the optimised Cd-pyramids are shown in Fig. 1.
After optimisation, a frequency analysis was carried out to ensure a local minimum on the potential energy surface (PES).
Some calculated properties are tabulated in Table 1.
It can be seen that both zinc and cadmium clusters exhibit clear trends for most of the properties presented.
The energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), an important stability factor, is, as expected, seen to decrease with increasing cluster size.
For the two smallest pyramids, Zn and Cd are seen to have similar gaps, but after that, the spacings between the frontier orbitals of the Cd pyramids are larger than those of the corresponding Zn species.
The pyramidal forms always have a larger gap than the lower symmetry isomers, this difference being larger for Cd.
The reasonable HOMO–LUMO gap of especially the smaller cluster sizes does not of course mean that they are energetically the most favourable structures.
For comparison, we also reoptimised the structures of ref. 8 at DFT level, imposing the suggested symmetry.
The energy difference between the Td symmetric isomers and the more disordered isomers is denoted by ΔEGupta in Table 1.
The energy order of the Zn clusters is as expected and predicted before; the tetrahedra lie higher in energy for N > 4 and the energy difference increases with cluster size.
The cadmium clusters, on the other hand, show a markedly different behaviour.
For Cd, the tetrahedra are favoured over the low-symmetry alternatives for Cd10 and Cd20.
Furthermore; the Td-structures of Cd35 and Cd56 are only moderately destabilised with respect to the disordered structures of .ref. 8
To further establish the stability of the pyramidal Cd10 and Cd20, the low-symmetry isomers were allowed to relax to even lower symmetry.
For Cd10, this led to a change to C3v-symmetry and a stabilisation of the higher-lying, low-symmetry conformer by 7 kJ mol−1.
The symmetry of Cd20 was lowered to Cs and the energy difference fell by 16 kJ mol−1, from 50 kJ mol−1 to 34 kJ mol−1.
The cadmium pyramids have large planar surfaces.
As the surface atoms have fewer bonding partners than atoms in a more contracted, amorphous structure, higher energies could be expected.
On the other hand, in solid Zn and Cd, the c/a ratio is anomalously large.
The ultimate reason for this trend does not seem to be well established.
A given atom prefers to have six nearest neighbours in a hexagonal lattice, and six others, further away in the two neighbouring planes.
As seen from Fig. 1, this is exactly what the present tetrahedra strive to do, visibly buckling outwards.
Also, as noted before,8 in order to increase their coordination number, the surface atoms tend to contract their bond lengths.
The shortest bonds in the pyramids are indeed found between surface atoms, the bond length systematically decreasing with pyramid size, as seen in Table 1.
Especially striking is the stability of the tetrahedral Cd20.
Here we have to point out that no rigorous conformer search for Cd20 has been performed, so only an upper limit for the energy difference between full and lesser order has been obtained.
A priori, nothing prevents a conformer even lower in energy than the pyramid from existing.
We believe this to be unlikely, however, at least at the level of theory used in this work.
Comparing Cd20 with the Au20 cluster of Li et al2. reveals many similarities; the most stable structure of both seems to be a tetrahedral pyramid, they both fulfil a “magic number” electron-shell closing rule for their suggested potentials, their HOMO–LUMO gap is nearly identical and both have previously been assigned disordered minima.
Why are the small Cd pyramids so stable?
The stability goes against the paradigm of Soler et al.,6 stating that the tendency for amorphisation should increase downwards (and to the right) in the periodic table.
One difference between Zn and Cd is that relativistic effects are more important for cadmium.
To check this, we performed a single point all-electron, non-relativistic calculation on Cd20, using the relativistic structures.
With relativistic effects omitted, the energy difference in favour of the pyramidal form decreases from 34 kJ mol−1 to only 10 kJ mol−1.
This finding is similar to what has been noted for gold clusters.
For gold, relativistic effects stabilise planar structures over 3D ones.13,14
The bond lengths seem to be indifferent to the inclusion of relativistic effects.
The bonds of the all-electron structure of Td-Cd20 are slightly shorter, but the difference is less than 1 pm.
In any case, the underlying reason for the stability of the Cd pyramids has to be a many-body effect, not accounted for by empirical potentials.
One possibly decisive effect is the nonmetal to metal transition threshold.
Zn clusters have been found to show stronger metallicity than Cd clusters,15 which again turn metallic at smaller N than Hg clusters.
In fact, the next pyramid in the Cd series, Cd84, is at least 126 kJ mol−1 higher in energy than the no-symmetry isomer of .ref. 8
A transition from moderate to large energy difference between order and disorder is then seen between N = 10–20 and N = 56–84 for the Zn and Cd pyramids, respectively.
We also briefly considered the tetrahedral HgN pyramids.
They have much longer bond lengths than the Cd pyramids, and are best characterized as van der Waals systems.
A further point is thermal accessibility.
For N = 56, the energy difference of 28 kJ mol−1 corresponds to a mean vibrational energy 3(N − 6)kT/2 or 0.37 kJ mol−1 mode−1, or a temperature of 45 K. Thus, at higher temperatures, both forms may be accessible.
This of course also applies in the cases where the pyramidal forms are more stable.
If the low-symmetry structures have higher entropies than the tetrahedral ones, they will be favoured further at finite temperatures by their free energy G = H − TS.
Concluding, we find that the CdN clusters with N = 4, 10 and 20 indeed seem to prefer tetrahedral symmetries, while those with N = 35 and 56 have low-lying tetrahedral minima, only slightly above the alternatives.
The ultimate driving force behind this remains unknown but could be related to the structure of the bulk metal, whose lattice parameters a resemble the present surface bond lengths.
Among the numerous disordered Cd clusters, it is pleasing to find these beautiful exceptions.
We duly note, however, that an exhaustive scan of the potential energy surface has not been performed; at present, this is still computationally unfeasible.
Collisions of excited Na atoms with N2, C2H2 and N2O molecules. Surface-hopping calculation of the Na(3p) fine structure population
The results of optical collision experiments: fine structure population ratios and polarization alignment angles obtained from scattering of Na atoms which are optically 3s → 3p excited during the collision with N2, C2H2 and N2O molecules, have been simulated numerically and analysed using quantum chemically computed potential energy surfaces, classical trajectory calculations and the semiclassical surface hopping method combined with a specially developed diabatization procedure.
Optical collisions are scattering processes where the projectile is optically excited during its interaction with the target.
This paper is concerned with the optical collision experiments of Na atoms with a series of molecules which have been carried out in the past few years by Grosser and coworkers1–3 following similar experiments with atomic targets.1,4,5
The experiments can briefly be explained as follows.
The collisions take place in a crossed beam arrangement.
The collision complexes are excited with polarized laser light and a detection laser is used to separate the excited Na atoms from the background.
The excitation laser is detuned by a few 100 cm−1 from the resonant 3s → 3p transition of Na, as a rule, but not always to higher frequency.
Therefore optical transitions occur only at those geometries, the so-called Condon configurations, where the energy difference in the collision complex corresponds just to the detuned laser frequency.
Excitation probability as a function of detuning and polarization angle is recorded for a few selected scattering angles.
From flight time measurement the velocity of the Na atoms after collision is obtained; this allows to reconstruct the kinematics of the observed scattering processes.
The goal of the experiments is to test the interaction potentials of excited Na with the target molecules and to obtain “snapshots” of the collision complexes, in particular of the direction of the 3p orbital after the process of optical excitation.
The results are presented as polar diagrams of the probability as a function of an orientation angle; they are analysed with the aid of numerical simulations using quantum chemically calculated potential surfaces and classical trajectories.2,3,6
A related experiment consists in measuring the ratio of excited Na atoms leaving the complex in the lower 3p1/2 fine structure state compared to the sum 3p1/2 + 3p3/2, the two levels being separated by spin–orbit interaction.3,5,7
Under the conditions the experiments have been carried out, the non-zero results for this ratio can be explained only by assuming non-adiabatic coupling effects between different excited electronic states.
Therefore precise knowledge of the interaction between the potentials is needed for a detailed understanding of the underlying process.
It is the aim of the present work to explain the observed fine structure ratios as functions of the kinetic energy after the collision numerically by combining classical trajectory methods with a semiclassical surface hopping procedure.
Upon collision of an excited Na(3p) atom with a target molecule the degeneracy of the atomic 3p levels is removed to an extent depending on the separation and arrangement of the collision complex.
In the case of a linear closed-shell target molecule as treated here three excited potential energy surfaces can be distinguished, two of 2A′ (electronic) symmetry and one 2A″.
The 3p charge distribution is no longer spherically symmetric as in the unperturbed atom.
In each of the excited components the 3p orbital is described by a real wave function and accordingly the excited Na atom has a quadrupole moment (of about −16.8 au).
The interaction of Na(3p) with the target is determined by the interaction of this quadrupole with the molecular multipole moments as well as by the dispersion effect.
Quantum chemically the latter is an effect of electron correlation whereas the multipole interactions can be treated already on the Hartree–Fock (HF) level.
It is important to have the correct orientation of the 3p atomic orbitals already in low order of the theoretical treatment.
In our calculations we therefore choose a slightly distorted (fixed) geometry for the target molecules such that the HF multipoles correctly reproduce the experimental moments.
Alternatively the molecular moments obtained from a correlated wave function could be used; we hope that the experimental moments also account for the average over the configurations of the rotating and vibrating target molecule.
In a previous paper6 we have explained how a qualitative understanding of the excited potential surfaces can be obtained if the most important contributions to the multipole interactions are discussed.
For every geometrical arrangement of the collision complex each one of the three 3p surfaces is characterized by the spatial orientation of the corresponding 3p orbital.
Whereas in the 2A″ state the 3p atomic orbital is perpendicular to the plane defined by the linear target and the Na atom, the two 2A′ states have in-plane 3p orbitals.
The expectation value of the 3p orbital direction after excitation leads to the so-called alignment angle, defined with respect to the center-of-mass (CM) trajectory of the incoming particle.
With quantum chemistry the 3p direction angles can easily be obtained by calculating the 3s → 3p transition moment vectors; except for very close separations they are mutually orthogonal.
For the descriptions of the experiments we also need the potential energy surface of the 3s ground state.
In this state the Na atom is approximately spherical; the surface is nearly structureless down to rather short distances where the Pauli repulsion sets in.
Furthermore on the three excited surfaces the spin–orbit interaction of the Na(3p) electron must be taken into account which contributes small corrections to the energies determined by the interaction of Na(3p) and the target molecule, in the order of the spin–orbit coupling constant of the Na(3p) state (11.5 cm−1).
Thus numerical simulation of the scattering experiments is carried out by running classical trajectories on the surfaces calculated with ab-initio quantum chemistry including electron correlation and the spin–orbit corrections.
The polarization of the laser radiation is taken into account by projecting onto the 3s → 3p transition dipole vector.
For this projection only the orientation of the transition vector is needed along the trajectories, not its value.
Therefore our method to obtain the correct multipole interaction on the HF level is very useful and saving computer time.
The three potential surfaces derived from the Na(3p) components may penetrate each other at certain geometrical arrangements, i.e. change their energetic ordering.
This situation favours non-adiabatic couplings.
Penetration of the two surfaces of 2A′ symmetry leads to conical intersections.
The 2A′ surfaces of the Na(3p) + HCCH system have such intersection points on the molecular axis, about 8 a0 off the position of the H atoms.
In the case of the N2, N2O (and CO2) target molecules, whose quadrupole moments are negative in contrast to HCCH, the penetration occurs on rings around the molecular axis with radii between 10 a0 (CO2) and 16.5 a0 (N2).
Evidently the probability that a Na trajectory passes close to an intersection point such that non-adiabatic processes can be expected is much higher for a ring-shaped intersection line than in the case of only two axial intersection points.
In this section we shall investigate the dynamics of the collision process taking place on the quantum chemically calculated potential energy surfaces.
The dynamics of nuclear motion is treated according to the concept of classical trajectories.
The relative velocity of the colliding particles at large distance and the rotational temperature of the molecule are specified by the experimental setup.
The impact parameter b and the initial rotational state of the molecule are determined by a random number generator for every trajectory.
The bond distances and angles of the target molecule are kept fixed at linear geometry, thus the surfaces become two dimensional and only five coordinates remain describing the dynamics of the system in the center of mass system.
At a distance depending on the detuning of the laser frequency the collision complex is excited to one of the states of the 3p-manifold.
The potential energy and transition dipole moment surfaces of the collision complexes Na + N2 and Na + C2H2 have been presented previously.2,6
Graphical representations of their transition vectors to the uppermost surfaces and of the Condon configurations for several detuning frequencies are shown below (Figs. 1 and 2).
The value of the transition moments is practically constant for all transitions and every configuration.
The direction of these vectors characterizes the surfaces and is important for the analysis.
The sudden change of orientation in the figures indicates the position of the conical intersection where two surfaces penetrate each other.
The quadrupole moments of the molecules were computed in HF approximation leading to the following results: 5.44 au for C2H2 and −0.93 au for N2.
The quantum chemical calculations for the system Na + N2O have been performed in a similar way.
The surfaces are functions of only two geometrical parameters, the center of mass distance R between the atom and the target molecule and the angle ϑ between R and the molecular axis.
The fixed bond lengths are 2.18 a0 for NN and 2.17 a0 for NO.
This corresponds essentially to shifting the central atom by 0.06 a0 towards the oxygen atom, as compared to the experimental geometry8 and yields a dipole moment of 0.07 au (0.17 D, O being the negative pole, exp.9
0.167 D) and a quadrupole moment of −2.85 au.
For the calculations a 7s7p4d3f ANO (atomic natural orbitals) basis set from Widmark et al. has been used10 for the target molecule and a selfmade 8s6p4d3f basis for the Na atom.
The dipole vector surfaces have been calculated in HF approximation; the uppermost dipole vector surface is shown in Fig. 3.
For the interaction energies we used the MCCEPA (multiconfiguration coupled electron pair approximation) program of Fink and Staemmler11 and single determinant (HF) reference functions.
In order to justify the approximation for the orientation of the transition dipoles as introduced in section 2 we have carried out test calculations for the Na + N2 and Na + N2O systems, evaluating the transition dipole vectors with correlated wave functions.
It turned out that although the values of the moments may change by up to 10 or 20% (mainly due to the reduced weight of the reference configurations in the correlated function) the orientation angles remain constant within 1° even for geometries close to a conical intersection where the electronic states are considerably mixed.
The potential and transition dipole surfaces were interpolated by two-dimensional spline functions.
The derivatives of the potential resulted from local expansions for every grid point and subsequent interpolation by spline functions.
We found the achieved smoothness sufficient for our Monte Carlo based simulation method.
The surfaces can be obtained from the authors on request.
In order to simulate the population of the fine structure states the adiabatic potential surfaces have to be modified, so that they include the spin–orbit interaction.
This can be achieved approximately by diagonalizing the matrix for every point of the 3p-manifold.
In the asymptotic region the three adiabatic energies e1, e2 and e3 are degenerate and the correct splitting a with the spin–orbit coupling constant a = 11.5 cm−1 results for Na(3p).
Usually with positive detuning the optical excitation of the collision complex leads exclusively to the population of the highest of the 3p states.
Therefore under condition of strictly adiabatic dynamics all sodium atoms would be in the 2P3/2 state after the collision.
The involved surfaces however show conical intersections which lead to non-adiabatic transitions and to the population of the lower 2P1/2 state.
In the asymptotic limit of infinite relative velocity of the colliding particles the 2P1/2/2P3/2 ratio is given by projection of the molecular state after excitation onto the final atomlike states 2PJ.5
Thus for high collision energy the relative 2P1/2 population is expected to approach 33%.
We use the semiclassical trajectory surface-hopping method developed by Preston and Tully12–15 which will be reviewed shortly in the following.
For every trajectory the probability of being on the excited surface number j is given by the squared absolute value of a time dependent coefficient cj(t).
The equation for the time derivative ċj(t) can be obtained by inserting the expansion for the electronic wave function Ψel(r,R(t)) into the time-dependent Schrödinger equation.14,16
The nuclear coordinates symbolized by R(t) are assumed to be functions of time t obeying classical equations of motion; r stands for the coordinates of the electrons.
In general the resulting expression for ċj(t) contains matrix elements 〈ψj|Hel|ψk〉 of the electronic Hamiltonian as well as matrix elements of the nuclear coordinate derivatives 〈ψj|∂/∂R|ψk〉.
Conventional quantum chemical programs yield adiabatic wave functions ψa that diagonalize the electronic Hamiltonian within the space of the electronic wave functions.
The calculation of matrix elements of ∂/∂R with these wave functions (neglected in the Born–Oppenheimer approximation) is very time consuming.
On the other hand these matrix elements become large in the region of a conical intersection or avoided crossing and are responsible for the radiationless transitions between different (adiabatic) electronic states.
A unitary transformation leads to a (quasi)-diabatic basis set ψd of electronic functions,17–20 which change as smoothly as possible with the nuclear coordinates and where the matrix elements of ∂/∂R are often assumed to be negligibly small.
In the case of only two involved states ψd1 and ψd2 this transformation is determined by the definition of an angle ϕ describing the mixing of the adiabatic states and depending on the nuclear coordinates.21
In the diabatic picture the matrix of the electronic Hamiltonian is no longer diagonal, but the matrix elements H12 = 〈ψd1|Hel|ψd2〉 can easily be calculated14,21 as soon as the mixing angle is known.
The expression for the off-diagonal element reads H12 = (E1 − E2)sin ϕ cos ϕ, where E1 and E2 are the adiabatic energies; the corresponding diagonal expressions are H11 = E1cos2ϕ + E2sin2ϕ and H22 = E1sin2ϕ + E2cos2ϕ.
With aj and bj we denote the complex time-dependent coefficients of eqn. (2) in the diabatic and adiabatic basis respectively.
Using the mixing angle ϕ the coefficients of the two different pictures can immediately be transformed into each other.
Including the partial derivatives with respect to the nuclear coordinates the following system of differential equations is obtained16,21 where the matrix elements Hjk(R(τ)) and 〈∂/∂R〉jk(R(τ)) are implicit functions of the runtime τ on the trajectory.
These semiclassical equations and the classical equations of motion are solved simultaneously by numerical integration.
After transformation to (quasi)diabatic electronic wave functions the matrix elements 〈∂/∂R〉jk may be neglected for intermediate relative velocities Ṙ.
However in our examples of optical collisions the correct 2P1/2 population for the asymptotic case of high velocity can only be obtained by maintaining the full operator.
A simple approximation for 〈∂/∂R〉jk will be introduced in section 4.1.
The transition to the uppermost 3p surface takes place when a trajectory crosses the line (Condon configuration) corresponding to the appropriate energy difference defined by the detuning.
At this moment the time-dependent coefficients in the adiabatic picture are set to b1 = 1 and b2 = 0.
Every trajectory is computed twice, corresponding to the two possibilities of excitation on the incoming and on the outgoing part of the path.
We denote these two cases with type 1 and type 2 respectively.
The (complex valued) diabatic coefficients aj are computed by numerical integration using eqn. (3) and transformed to b1 = a1cos ϕ + a2sin ϕ and b2 = −a1sin ϕ + a2cos ϕ after every time step.
When the probability |bi|2 falls below 0.5 a random decision is made whether to hop to the other surface or not, and then the coefficients are reset accordingly.
In the case of a hop the momentum of nuclear motion has to be corrected in order to ensure energy conservation.
Following this procedure several hops between the two in plane states including the spin–orbit correction (1) are possible per trajectory.
As is to be expected most hops occur not too far from the conical intersection.
The number of trajectories ending in the two states 2P1/2 and 2P3/2 have to be weighted with the values of the impact parameter before being interpreted as probability.
In the neighbourhood of a conical intersection the adiabatic wave functions are rapidly changing.
This is illustrated e.g. by the behaviour of the orientation of the transition moment vector to the higher 2A′ state (shown in Figs. 1–3) which in fact maps the orientation of the Na(3p) orbital in the final state.
Due to the orthogonality constraint the 3p orbital in the lower excited 2A′ state (not shown) has an orientation rotated by 90°.
Diabatic wave functions are obtained by a transformation of the mixed adiabatic states (in our case a 2 × 2 rotation) such that a suitable molecular property behaves as smoothly as possible.
For that we compare the orientation of the 3p orbitals with the orientation of a classical 3p quadrupole Q in the field of the electric multipoles of the target molecule.
The classical quadrupole–dipole term of the interaction potential e.g. reads where μ is the dipole moment of the molecule.
The position of the sodium atom relative to the molecule is given in polar coordinates (R,ϑ) and α is the direction angle of the Na quadrupole (with α = 0 defined as the direction of the vector connecting the molecule and the sodium atom).
Analogous expressions hold for the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction and for higher interaction terms; in general the potential V(R,ϑ,α) is a sum of such terms.
For energy calculations this approach would not be sufficient because the polarization effects are missing.
But as we need only orientation angles and since polarizabilities are essentially isotropic and do not affect the 3p orientation our approximation seems to be justified.
In the classical picture we cannot distinguish two interacting electronic states.
Hence there is no conical intersection, but there are two mutually orthogonal angles α1 and α2 corresponding to minimal and maximal interaction energy.
The angles αi can be determined by the condition The direction α1 as a function of R and ϑ is also shown in Figs. 1 to 3.
In the asymptotic region far away from the conical intersection the angles αi coincide with the two directions of the transition dipole moments to the ground state, but they behave smoothly also near the intersection points.
Therefore we force the 3p orbitals of the diabatic wave functions to coincide with these classical angles everywhere.
In other words the deviation of the transition dipole vector direction to the highest 3p surface from the angle α1 can serve as a “diabatization angle” ϕ defining the transformation to the (quasi)-diabatic states.
Note that the classical orientation angles are only weakly dependent on the exact values of the molecular multipoles.
In all interaction terms (e.g. eqn. (4)) the Na quadrupole moment is only a factor which does not affect the α values of stationary energy.
Furthermore it is rather the ratio of the molecular multipole moments than their absolute value which determines the orientation angles.
The function α(R, ϑ) has been approximated using the values of the molecular dipole and quadrupole moments given in section 3.1.
In addition in order to improve the agreement of the two angles in the areas where there is no mixing of the adiabatic states we have adjusted in a semiempirical way the hexadecupole terms for all three investigated molecules.
The Figs. 1 to 3 show the directions of α1 and of the transition dipole vectors for the three molecules.
The mixing angle ϕ has been determined as difference between these two directions.
Thus in principle the transformation can directly be read from the figures.
In our examples with only two involved states a necessary condition for a considerable change of probability in (3) is that the absolute values of H12 and thus of sin ϕ and cos ϕ are not too small, and this is the case whenever the two adiabatic states are considerably mixed.
It can easily be seen in Figs. 1 to 3 that the necessary mixing angles around 45° are found only in rather restricted regions close to the conical intersections.
Fig. 4 shows the resulting fine structure populations for optical collisions of Na with the molecules N2 and N2O for the rotational temperature 100 K and at a detuning value of 120 cm−1.
To facilitate comparison of our trajectory simulations with the experimental results3 (and Fig. 5), measured at a laboratory scattering angle of 18°, the abscissa is chosen to be the relative kinetic energy after collision.
Our 2P1/2 fractions represented by solid lines were computed neglecting the matrix elements of ∂/∂R in the diabatic picture.
Instead in order to ensure the correct asymptotic probability (33%) for high relative velocity a simple correction was applied: the matrix element 〈∂/∂R〉(R,ϑ) in (3) was assumed to be proportional to the radial derivative of the mixing angle ϕ.
The proportionality constant f in Ṙ〈∂/∂R〉12 ≈ fṘ∂ϕ(R,ϑ)/∂R was adjusted individually for N2 and N2O at high velocities.
Maintaining the same constant in the full range of relative motion leads to the dashed curves in Fig. 4.
The error bars in the figures were determined by separate statistical test runs and do not represent any systematic error of our calculation method.
A qualitative discussion of the results has to consider the position of the conical intersection as well as the Na-molecule distance at which the optical excitation occurs.
For Na + N2 the location of the conical intersection is definitely the most favorable for a high 2P1/2 fraction.
Our calculated percentage, which is slightly decreasing in the investigated range of collision energy, is in excellent agreement with measurement.3
The relative contribution of type 2 trajectories on the 2P1/2 surface decreases from about 50% to about 25% with increasing relative velocity.
For the Na + N2O system the 120 cm−1 Condon line is situated at a radial distance which lies just inside the conical intersection.
Thus less than 10% of the 2P1/2 trajectories are of type 2 except for very low collisional energy.
The experimental population of the lower spin–orbit state is reproduced satisfactorily by our computations for this collision complex too.
Only excitations to the uppermost 3p surface were taken into account in the calculations for Na + N2 and Na + N2O. In the case of Na + C2H2 corresponding simulations lead to a population of the 2P1/2 state which is considerably much lower than according to the experiment.3
The conical intersection is located in collinear geometry for C2H2, what means that much fewer trajectories pass through this region of strong mixing than for N2 and N2O, where the non-adiabatic coupling is strong at T-shaped geometry.
Further the Condon configuration for the detuning by 120 cm−1 is situated clearly outside of the conical intersection region on the C2H2 surface.
For that reason no non-adiabatic transitions to the 2P1/2 state can result from type 2 trajectories for C2H2.
The calculated 2P1/2 populations for Na + C2H2 at a detuning value of 120 cm−1 and for the rotational temperature 100 K are shown in Fig. 6.
The low probability of non-adiabatic transitions in the case of Na + C2H2 represented by the dashed curves is not able to explain the rather high measured 2P1/2 fraction.3
But in contrast to the other two investigated molecules the energy differences between the 3p surfaces are much smaller, so that excitations of the lower two 3p states are possible.
At a detuning of 120 cm−1 the number of excitations to the uppermost surface is about three times higher than to each one of the lower surfaces.
After excitation to the lower one of the two mixed A′ surfaces most trajectories will contribute to the 2P1/2 population because of the low non-adiabatic transition likelihood.
The third state (A″) with the 2P3/2 asymptotic limit was assumed not to mix with the other two states.
The results represented by solid lines in Fig. 6 were obtained including excitations to all three surfaces and are in good agreement with experiment.
A test calculation for Na + N2O showed that less than 15% of the excitations take place to the lower A′ state and many of these trajectories jump back to the uppermost surface.
So it seems reasonable to consider only excitations to the highest 3p surface except for the system Na + C2H2.
As mentioned in section 2 the intensity of the Na(3s → 3p) transition depends on the polarization direction angle β of the excitation laser.
Table 1 shows classical trajectory results for the scattering angle ΘCM = 40° and several values of the detuning frequency.
A qualitative discussion of this method can be found in .ref. 2
β is measured relative to the incidence direction of the Na atom.
For example β = ΘCM denotes the situation where polarization is parallel to the Na momentum vector after collision.
For all three examined molecules the weight of the type 1 trajectories is dominant, leading to an optimal polarization direction in backward direction (β > 90°).
Figs. 1, 2 and 3 are useful for a qualitative understanding: For large detuning frequencies the transition dipole vector points more or less in radial direction towards the center of mass of the molecule for all possible Condon points.
The distance between the condon points for type 1 and type 2 trajectories decreases with increasing detuning, resulting in alignment angles near 90° and large alignment ratios.
For 120 cm−1 detuning frequency the direction of the transition dipole vector shows more variation for Na + N2O and Na + C2H2, explaining the rather small alignment ratios.
The calculated alignment results may be compared with measurements for Na + N2 and Na + C2H22,3 (and Table 1).
While the experimental data are reproduced satisfactorily for the N2 system the rotation of the alignment angle and the decrease of the alignment ratio at small detuning frequency are clearly underestimated for C2H2 by our calculations.
In the case of C2H2 excitations to all three surfaces of the 3p-manifold were included.
The presented results for the population of the Na(3p) fine structure states after an optical collision with a linear molecule are in good agreement with the experiment.3
Our simulations are based on quantum chemically calculated potential energy surfaces and dipole moment functions.
Nuclear dynamics was treated in the framework of the semiclassical surface hopping method.
In order to test the effect of molecular vibration we introduced a harmonic potential for N2 allowing the exchange of vibrational energy with the other degrees of freedom.
Neither for the population of the Na(3p) fine structure states nor for the alignment direction and ratio a significant change within the statistical uncertainty could be found.
We therefore conclude that our assumption of fixed molecular geometry is a reasonable approximation.
The analysis of the results for the 2P1/2 fraction after collision shows a sensitive dependence on the details of the energy surfaces, the non-adiabatic mixing of states and especially on the location of the conical intersections.
The experimentally observed dependence of the Na(3s → 3p) transition intensity on the polarization direction angle of the excitation laser may be understood qualitatively from the properties of the potential and dipole moment surfaces.
The deviations between experiment and simulation are largest for small detuning frequencies.
The success of our simulations of the optical collision experiments is a strong indication for the correct understanding of the underlying physical processes.
Geometrical vs. statistical models for describing phase transition kinetics in thin films
We present calculations and simulations to investigate different theories describing phase transitions in thin films, with special emphasis on the growth of the new phase after nucleation.
In particular, models with geometric and statistical growth rules are compared.
It is demonstrated that the commonly employed geometrical approach, which assumes nucleation and subsequent radial growth of the newly formed phase, has distinct limitations for thin film systems.
More realistic statistical Monte Carlo simulations that are governed by statistical growth rules, predict that a non-spherical (prolate) shape may develop after nucleation at or near a surface or interface.
In addition, the predicted kinetics of the phase transformation is notably different for the geometric vs. the statistical model, for similar parameters.
The simulation results are compared to recent experiments on the crystallization of thin amorphous solid water films.
The transformation of materials from the amorphous to the crystalline phase and its theoretical description have received considerable attention due to its relevance for areas as diverse as polymer science,1,2 interstellar physical chemistry,3–5 semiconductor technology6 and metallurgy.7
Particular attention has been paid to the kinetics of this transition in thin films, for reasons of experimental sample geometry and to mimic finite-size effects in naturally occurring systems.
For example, the crystallization of amorphous solid water in confined geometries has received significant attention the past decade.5,8–23
There has recently been renewed interest in theories that predict the crystallized fraction as a function of time (as this constitutes the commonly measured quantity), and its sensitivity to the various parameters associated with the phase transition: the nucleation probability, the rate of subsequent growth and the desorption rate of material from the thin films, if pertinent.
These analytical theories (see e.g.refs. 16, 24–26) are based on Avrami’s seminal contribution27 and assume that nucleation sites are randomly distributed throughout the volume (or over the surface) of the initial phase and appear with a fixed probability per unit volume (per unit surface area) per unit time.
The subsequent growth is radial, with a constant velocity.
In these models, the growth criterion is therefore non-local and geometric: if a point within the layer is sufficiently close to a nucleation center, it will have changed phase.
At any point in the layer, the probability for conversion therefore does not depend on the local environment of that point, but depends on how far it is removed from a crystallization nucleus and how much time has elapsed after nucleation, hence the denotation geometric, or non-local.
The geometric model has recently been extended to include the different desorption rates from the different phases in simulations by Ahlström et al.28
Although this geometrical model has been successfully applied in a number of cases,12,16,19,20,23–26,28 it does not account for the finite size of the (molecular) elements in the system.
As a continuum model, the geometrical approach implicitly relies on a sample size well exceeding the size of its molecular constituents; this approximation therefore must break down when the sample size is on the order of typical molecular diameter.
For very small samples, a local, statistical description for the growth would seem more appropriate.
In such a statistical model, the probability for, say, a water molecule to become part of the crystalline phase, is determined by the phase state of its immediate surroundings in a statistical manner; if the surrounding is predominantly crystalline, the chance of phase transformation will be large.
To investigate possible shortcomings of the non-local geometrical model in finite-size systems, we compare the results of geometrical models with the results of the most basic statistical (local) model that predicts spherical growth in bulk media: an atomistic lattice model simulation29,30 based on a Monte Carlo approach.
As opposed to the non-local growth rule of the geometric model, the Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are characterized by statistical growth behavior in the following manner: a film is subdivided into cells, and the individual cells can crystallize depending on the state of their direct neighbors.
The growth criteria for the MC simulation are the simplest that reproduce three-dimensional spherical growth in the bulk, without any prior knowledge of the energetics of the process.
Although both approaches therefore in principle give rise to the same shape of crystalline domains, a comparison of the MC simulations of the crystallization and growth process (using local, statistical criteria) with the Avrami-type (non-local) geometrical approach for finite sized systems reveals distinct differences between the two methods.
First of all, we demonstrate that the statistical model predicts that the growth rate depends on the size of the converted region, and therefore on time, as opposed to the geometric model that assumes time-independent growth rate.
This effect is not limited to thin films.
Additional discrepancies appear when nucleation occurs at or near the surface or an interface of a thin film.16,24–26
Whereas, again, for the geometrical model the growth rate is constant, for the statistical model the presence of the surface decelerates crystal growth near the surface.
As a result, for the MC simulation, the transformed region does not exhibit the shape of a truncated sphere, as predicted by geometrical models, but rather by a truncated prolate spheroid.
This is not a purely abstract issue, as there have recently been two independent reports for nucleation of the thermodynamically stable phase at the surface: for the crystallization of amorphous solid water23 and polymers31.
As we are interested in very thin films, the film dimensions will be expressed in monolayers (ML) throughout this paper, corresponding to approximately one molecular diameter.
Time will simply be expressed in seconds.
The phase transformation in a thin film, such as the crystallization of amorphous solid water, requires the nucleation and growth of small crystalline domains in the amorphous phase.
In the two models described here, nucleation occurs in the same manner, but the growth rules differ.
Nucleation occurs at random times at random positions within the layer, or on its surface.
The nucleation probability for bulk nucleation is defined per unit volume per unit time Jbulk (expressed in ML−3 s−1).
For nucleation occurring at the surface, it is defined per unit surface area per unit time Jsurf (expressed in ML−2 s−1).
The energy barrier that must be overcome to form a crystalline nucleus is determined by, amongst other, a competition between the surface tension that arises between the two phases upon nucleation (counteracting nucleation) and the difference in chemical potential between the two phases (favoring nucleation, as the crystalline phase is thermodynamically most stable).
As a result, the instantaneously converted volume (critical nucleus size) that appears upon nucleation will contain a significant number of molecules (previously reported to be ∼100 for water crystallization19).
The size of the, assumed to be spherical, critical nucleus is defined by its radius r* (expressed in ML).
The subsequent growth of crystalline domains is modeled in two different manners, as introduced above: through a geometric criterion, and by statistical growth rules, that are explained in the following.
For the MC simulations, a cubic lattice of (100 × 100 × 50) cells is employed, and the different cells are distinguished by their spatial coordinates (x,y,z).
The choice of 50 for the thickness was motivated by recent experiments on the crystallization of amorphous solid water in which a layer thickness of approximately this number of molecules was employed.23
Note, however, that the results described here are not specific to this thickness.
In any case, this comparison to experiment implies that each cell corresponds to one water molecule.
Any of the cells may be untransformed (amorphous) or transformed (crystalline), defined with cell values Θ = 0 and Θ = 1, respectively.
The phase state of each cell is evaluated in every time step Δt employed in the simulations.
The nucleation process is treated in the following manner: For each time step, the discrete number of nucleation events is determined by the nucleation probability Jbulk, in conjunction with the system volume V and time step Δt employed in the simulations.
This number is obtained from a simulated Poisson distribution, whose mean is given by the product JbulkVΔt.
For surface nucleation, the Poisson mean is given by JsurfAΔt, with A the surface area on which nucleation occurs.
The critical nucleus size, whose size is defined by its radius r*, subsequently grows using local, statistical growth rules: a cell at position (x,y,z) has a certain probability of crystallizing either as a result of a nucleation event, or a growth event if one of its 26 neighboring cells is crystalline.
This means that the probability for conversion of the cell is determined by its immediate surroundings (local), as opposed to the geometrical (non-local) growth rule, which simply considers the distance from a nucleation center (see below).
Note that, as depicted in Fig. 1, a cell has three types of neighbors: N1 = 6 direct neighbors that share a face, at a distance of the unit cell size l, N√2 = 12 neighbors that share an edge at a distance of √2l, and N√3 = 8 neighbors that share a corner point, at a distance of √3l.
The probability Ptrans for the crystallinity to propagate to an adjacent cell is inversely proportional to the geometric distance, and linearly proportional to elapsed time.
It is important to note that these growth criteria are the simplest that ensure spherical growth in three dimensions (growth through just nearest-neighbor faces results in a diamond-shaped volume).
It is evident that the criteria for spherical growth such as defined here for a cubic lattice, with hopping probability inversely proportional to the geometric distance to a neighbor, are readily extrapolated to other types of lattices.
Ideally, one would like the growth criteria to be determined by the energetics associated with the growth process.32
Unfortunately, however, for most systems (as is also the case for the transition from amorphous solid water to crystalline ice), very little is known about these energetics.
Therefore we adopt this statistical approach.
At every time step, for each cell that has not yet been transformed, the state of its 26 neighbors is evaluated.
The probability that during this time step this cell will transform equals:with summations over the cell values Θ of the different types of neighboring cells: ΘN1, ΘN√2 and ΘN√3 (Θ = 1 (or 0) for an (un)transformed cell).
Pprop represents the probability to propagate via a face, which is proportional to the time step size and the growth rate.
A random number between zero and one is then computer generated, and if this number is smaller than Ptrans, the value of the cell Θ changes from zero to one as a result of crystallization.
Otherwise, it remains unchanged.
Care was taken to ensure that the results were independent of the size of the time step used in the simulations, i.e. to keep Pprop sufficiently small.
From a set of simulations with varying time step size, it is clear that, if Pprop is set to be smaller than 0.015 per time step, the results converge.
In the simulations reported here, we set Pprop = 0.01 per time step.
For convenience, time is expressed in seconds in the remainder of this report.
To account for contributions of spheres nucleated outside, but grown into, the considered (100 × 100 × 50) volume, the simulation volume is embedded in a larger volume (typically (300 × 300 × 50)), i.e. the lateral dimensions (but not the thickness) of the simulation volume are enlarged by an amount determined by the product of the maximum growth rate and the total simulation time.
The (100 × 100 × 50) volume is then analyzed to determine the time-dependent converted fraction.
We did not use periodic boundary conditions, as the statistical fluctuations in nucleation and growth rates are amplified in that way.
Desorption was included in some of the simulations in a non-statistical manner, simply by reducing the layer thickness from the top as a function of time.
The presented results are averages of 30 simulation runs, to reduce the effects of statistical fluctuations in the growth process.
A set of 30 simulations typically takes 10 h on a desktop personal computer.
The converted volume as a function of time can be obtained by evaluating the summation of cell values over all cells: Vconv = ∑x,y,zΘx,y,z.
The time-dependent crystalline fraction is given by dividing Vconv by the total considered simulation volume.
The time-dependent crystallinity at the surface or at the sample–support interface can be obtained analogously (experimentally, the thin water layers are deposited on a support).
For the model that assumes geometrical (non-local) growth, nucleation occurs as described above, but the description of the growth of the nucleus is governed by geometric considerations: growth simply occurs radially from a nucleation center at geometric rate Ggeo (in units ML s−1).
Thus, if nucleation of the new phase occurs at time τ, and the nucleus has an initial radius r*, then the radius r of the sphere at time t >τ equals r = r* + Ggeo (t − τ).
It is therefore evident that any cell at position (x,y,z) is crystalline if the inequality:is satisfied, for any of the nucleation sites (xi,yi,zi).
If one is interested in the overall kinetics (i.e. the converted crystalline fraction as a function of time) one can derive analytical expressions describing the kinetics, as reported in detail in refs. 16 and 26.
The essence of the derivation of these expressions is that the converted (crystalline) volume is calculated as a function of time for all nucleated regions.
Because the nucleation probability per unit volume and unit time, Jbulk, is independent of elapsed time and position, so-called ‘phantom nuclei’27 may appear in already transformed regions and transformed regions may overlap.
This approach results in the calculation of a time-dependent extended volume N(t) (i.e. doubly counting overlapping regions), from which the real crystalline volume X(t) follows through the relation X(t) = 1 − exp[−N(t)]27.N(t) is calculated by considering all possible nucleation events, i.e. by integrating the function N(t,τ) over all times τ up to time t.
The result can be directly related to the converted fraction of bulk material.
Following26 (neglecting the desorption of material from film), this results in the following expression for N(t), for a layer of thickness d:Similar expressions for the surface and sample–support interface crystallinities can be readily derived following the procedure in ref. 26, as well as the corresponding expressions for surface nucleation.
These expressions including desorption can be found in the same reference.26
In analogy to the statistical growth criterion, one can also perform simulations using a non-local, geometric criterion, as demonstrated previously in .ref. 28
The results of such simulations for the non-local geometric approach are in perfect agreement with the analytical results, the only difference being the discrete nature of the lattice in the simulation that gives rise to a quantized increase in the converted fraction.
Two types of investigations were performed: one with fixed nucleation site, and one with random nucleation throughout the film.
The first allows us to investigate the differences between statistical and geometric growth rules regarding the shape of the transformed volume.
Two limiting cases are considered: nucleation in the center of the film at cell (x,y,z) = (50,50,25), and on the surface at (50,50,1), at time t = 0 s.
In the second case (random nucleation throughout the film) we investigate the effect of the different types of simulated growth on the time-dependent fraction of converted material, to mimic typical experimental approaches.
For each of these cases (fixed and random nucleation), statistical and geometric growth criteria were employed.
The results for fixed nucleation site will be discussed first.
We first consider nucleation in the precise center of the film, at cell (x,y,z) = (50,50,25), with a critical nucleus consisting of only one cell.
The parameters used in the simulation were Δt = 0.1 s and Pprop = 0.01 per time step Δt.
Although both models indeed produce spherical growth, a number of striking differences appear between the two models.
The first is that the rate of radial growth, which is defined as constant in the non-local geometric model, increases in the course of time in the MC simulations for statistical growth by a factor of 6.
For the non-local geometrical model, the growth rate Ggeo is simply defined as the rate of change in the sphere radius r, i.e. Ggeo = ∂r/∂t.
In the MC simulation, for statistical growth, the sphere is not necessarily perfectly round and compact, but we can still define an effective radius reff by calculating the radius corresponding to the converted volume Vconv = ∑x,y,zΘx,y,z, as if it were a perfect sphere: .
Thus, we can compare the geometric non-local growth rate with that observed in the statistical MC simulations by comparing Ggeo with the time-dependent radial growth rate in the MC simulations defined as: GMC = ∂reff/∂t.
These quantities are plotted vs. time in Fig. 2.
The time range (0–14 s) is sufficiently small so that the sphere does not reach the sample edges.
For the parameter set Δt = 0.1 s and Pprop = 0.01, the long-time growth equals ∼1.58 ML s−1 for the MC simulations.
For the non-local geometric model, the growth rate is set to be Ggeo = 1.58 ML s−1 in eqns. (2) and (3) and is, of course, time-independent.
The increase in the growth rate observed in the statistical MC model can be understood as follows: consider an untransformed cell at the edge of the transformed volume.
In the very beginning, there is only one pathway for the considered cell to become transformed, through the face of the adjacent, initially transformed cell at (50,50,25).
In other words, the curvature of the crystallized ‘sphere’ is so large, that only one pathway is available.
When the radius becomes very large (and the curvature small) a cell bordering the transformed volume will experience the oncoming transformed front as a flat front, and there will be nine pathways for the cell to become transformed: one as before, and an additional eight from cells sharing cube edges and corner points (four and four, respectively).
The growth probability per time step therefore increases from Pprop at small times to (Pprop + 4Pprop/√2 + 4Pprop/√3) at large times.
For growth along a linear, one-dimensional chain, it is clear that the growth rate is given by GMC = 2Pprop/Δt, the factor of two accounting for the fact that growth will occur in two directions.
This should also be the initial growth rate for our system, as borne out in the simulations: GMC = 0.2 ML s−1 for t → 0 (see Fig. 2).
For long times, one might expect a growth rate of GMC(t → ∞) = 2(Pprop + 4Pprop/√2 + 4Pprop/√3)/Δt = 1.23 ML s−1, following the reasoning above.
The observed long-time growth rate is larger than this simple estimate, amounting to ∼1.58 ML s−1.
This is due to the fact that there are additional, indirect pathways through the three-dimensional system (not considered in the simple argument presented above) that contribute to the growth rate.
We find the phenomenological relationship GMC (t → ∞) ≈15.8 Pprop/Δt, which will be used below.
The black line in Fig. 2 is the prediction of the time-dependent growth rate from the aforementioned simple considerations: this calculated rate is related to the curvature of the sphere, 1/reff through G = 1.58 − 1/reff.
It provides a reasonable description of the simulation results.
Hence it is evident that the main contribution to the time-dependent growth rate originates from the time-dependent curvature of the transformed sphere.
It should be noted that the limiting large-radius value for GMC, GMC (t → ∞), is reached relatively soon, in terms of the transformed volume, as demonstrated in the inset of Fig. 2.
For example, for a critical nucleus containing 100 cells (i.e. water molecules),19 the initial growth rate is 0.7 G∞, rather than 0.13 G∞ for a nucleus of size one.
Besides the different growth rates, a second marked difference between the statistical and the geometrical model is that the transformed region reaches the surface appreciably earlier for the statistical MC results, despite the slower initial growth.
This is illustrated in Fig. 3, which shows the radii of the two differently growing spheres.
The plot depicts rbulk − the bulk radius derived from the volume of the sphere – and rsurf – the radius of the circle of the exposed area of the sphere at the surface.
The expressions for rbulk and rsurf read: , as introduced above, and, analogously, , i.e. proportional to the square root of the area associated with cells that have crystallized at the surface.
It is evident from Fig. 3 that for identical long-time growth rates (i.e. Ggeo = GMC (t → ∞) = 1.58 ML s−1), the transformed sphere reaches the surface at t = 13 s for the MC simulation, and at t = 16 s for the non-local geometrical model, despite the fact that the radius of the geometrical sphere is ∼20% greater than the effective radius of the (statistical) MC result at this time, owing to the delayed initial growth for the MC sphere.
Whereas the geometrically grown sphere is fully compact, the MC sphere is not; it has a fill factor of roughly ∼80%, with a strongly non-uniform crystalline density (the center is mostly crystalline).
As a result, the sphere may reach the surface before rbulk = 25 ML, which is the geometric criterion for reaching the surface.
The non-compact nature of the MC sphere is illustrated in the right panel of Fig. 3, which depicts a slice through the xy-plane at z = 25 for a sphere that nucleated at point (50,50,25), i.e. through the center of the sphere, from one randomly chosen simulation run.
It is evident that in real life, the precise shape of a cross section such as presented in Fig. 3 is the result of many competing factors, such as entropy (favoring a ‘rough’ sphere surface), surface tension (favoring a perfect circle) by possible variations in local growth rate due to e.g. density fluctuations and varying growth rates along different crystallographic axes.
Neither of the models presented here takes these effects into account, as very little is known about these effects.
In addition, potential effects of the underlying support that is present in the experiments are neglected, as these effects can be suppressed for appropriate substrates.23
A third difference between crystal growth determined by statistical and geometric rules is the shape of the crystalline domain in the proximity of the surface(s).
Whereas for the non-local (geometrical) case, this shape is always a (truncated) sphere, for the statistical growth criterion the domain deviates from spherical growth, resulting in a deformed crystalline domain shape.
This is most clear for nucleation immediately at the surface (center placed at point (50,50,1)).
This is illustrated in Fig. 4, which depicts the simulation volume projected onto one of its sides, i.e. integrated over one of the coordinates parallel to the surface: I(y,z) = ∑xΘx,y,z, for both the non-local geometrical and the statistical MC model.
In addition to the non-spherical behavior of the MC model, it is also clear from Fig. 4 that the apparent nucleation site is situated ∼5 cells below the surface (at z = 5), although the real site is at z = 1.
This is clearly observed from the contour lines (also plotted in the graph).
This somewhat surprising result can be understood in the following manner: Consider 2 cells, at the same distance from the surface nucleation site (N), but one straight down into the bulk (A) and one in the plane of the surface (B).
In the non-local, geometrical growth model, as the distances N–A and N–B are identical, A and B become crystalline at the same point in time, and lie on the same contour line.
With the statistical (local) growth rules, crystallization of cells A and B can occur through one of the many pathways by which the crystalline front can propagate from cell N. However, due to the broken symmetry at the surface, it is clear that there are roughly twice as many pathways from N to A, as there are from N to B, as the crystalline phase cannot propagate through vacuum.
As a result, growth of the nucleus along the coordinate parallel to the surface plane is slower than growth along the coordinate perpendicular to the surface.
A consequence of this behavior is that the exposed surface area of the converted volume is smaller than what one would expect from the non-local geometric model.
This effect can be quantified by considering the ratio of rbulk (now defined as , since only half a sphere is formed) and rsurf, defined as above.
The anisotropy in rbulk/rsurf is a good measure for the deviation from spherical behavior, as, in case of surface nucleation, it always equals 1 for the geometrical model.
Fig. 5 represents the time-dependent anisotropy in apparent radii in the bulk and at the surface, and demonstrates that this effect is largest for short times.
As mentioned already briefly above, it should be stressed that both the models described here are phenomenological and neither explicitly takes into account the thermodynamic quantities that are relevant for the crystallization and growth process.
In particular, for the crystallization of water, which is driven by the difference in chemical potential between the two phases, the nucleation and growth will be determined by surface tension between the two phases and density effects.
For instance, the effect of the density difference between the amorphous and the crystalline phase (0.94 g cm−321 and 0.93 g cm−3,13 respectively) will raise the nucleation barrier, and presumably impede growth of larger crystallites due to strain effects.
For crystalline grains reaching the surface, additional contributions arise: first, the three-phase line tension must be taken into account, which will raise the free energy as a larger part of the surface is converted, and therefore will slow down the growth along the surface.
Secondly, there is a surface tension difference between the amorphous–vacuum interface and the crystalline–vacuum interface.
Unfortunately, the magnitude, and sometimes even the sign, of many of these quantities are unknown.
This is one of the motivations for taking the most simple approaches to both the statistical and geometric growth.
To investigate to what extent the aforementioned effects influence the interpretation of experimental results, we investigate the quantity that is generally determined experimentally: the time-dependent fraction of converted material.
Although both surface and bulk fractions are experimentally accessible, for simplicity we will first restrict ourselves to the bulk fraction, for nucleation of the new phase occurring in the bulk of the material.
We use values for the nucleation and growth parameters that have been reported previously for crystallization kinetics of thin water films: Jbulk = 2.0 × 10−7 ML−3 s−1 and G = 5.0 × 10−2 ML s−1.28
Whereas J is uniquely defined in both the non-local geometric and the statistical MC simulations, the growth rate G is only in the former, as in the MC simulations, G depends both on time and the initial critical nucleus size.
In the simulations, we choose the numerical parameters Pprop and Δt such that GMC (t → ∞) = 5.0 × 10−2 ML s−1, since GMC (t → ∞) = 15.8 Pprop/Δt (see above).
To be as realistic as possible, we chose a critical nucleus size of not only r* = 0.5 ML (corresponding to a nucleus of one cell in diameter) but also r* = 3 ML, the latter corresponding to a critical nucleus containing 93 cells (the specific value of 93 is dictated by the discrete character of the lattice), in agreement with previous estimates of the critical nucleus.28
The Monte Carlo approach is further detailed in the section ‘approach’ above.
The results of these simulations for both the non-local geometric and statistical MC models are depicted together in Fig. 6; there is a clear discrepancy between the results of the two models, despite the identical nucleation parameters.
It is interesting to note that in both cases the shapes of the two curves are nearly identical, but the MC result is offset in time due to the time-dependent growth rate.
As expected, the temporal offset is largest for r* = 0.5 ML, as the initial growth rate for the small nucleus is relatively low (see Fig. 2).
For the case of r* = 3.0 ML, the geometrical model describes the kinetics observed in the MC simulations best with parameter values J = 6.0 × 10−8 ML−3s−1, G = 7.0 × 10−2 ML s−1 (keeping r* fixed at 3.0 ML), i.e. significantly different from the parameter values used in the simulations.
Finally, we make a direct comparison to experiments recently reported in .ref. 23
In these experiments, surface crystallization of a thin amorphous water film was reported.
Here, we compare results of the geometric and statistical models with previously inferred26 crystallization parameters: Jsurf = 4.5 × 10−7 ML−3 s−1, G = 0.17 ML s−1, rdes = 0.04 ML s−1 and r* = 3.0 ML.
The results of the calculations, performed for a layer of 45 ML thickness (instead of 50 ML as in the previous part of this paper), are plotted in Fig. 7, from which it is immediately evident that the results of the two models are not very different.
The main difference is the smaller temporal separation between the calculated surface and bulk fractions for the statistical model compared to the geometrical one.
This is a consequence of the non-spherical shape that appears for surface nucleation in the statistical model, with growth lagging in the surface plane; As a result, the surface crystallinity is retarded compared to the geometrical case.
The observation that there is no significant time lag for all three curves (as opposed to the results presented in Fig. 6) can be understood by noting that, for the surface nucleation parameters used in the calculations, the crystalline growth advances through the layer as one front, as depicted in the inset in Fig. 7.
As nucleation occurs in one plane, the converted regions appear close to each other, allowing them to merge relatively soon.
The long-time growth rate GMC (t → ∞) is therefore reached at an early time, also due to the relatively large r* = 3.0 ML.
It is evident that for these nucleation parameters, the difference between statistical and geometrical growth is rather small; this, however, is not necessarily true for other systems, and depends intricately on the values of the nucleation parameters.
We have investigated the effect of different crystallization models on the observed phase transition kinetics in thin films.
A simple statistical Monte Carlo routine is presented that allows us to follow the phase transition in space and time.
A comparison between the result of these Monte Carlo simulations and the routinely employed geometric models reveal a time-dependent growth rate for statistical growth, whereas the growth rate is assumed constant for geometric models.
Moreover, the assumed spherical shape for geometric models is not observed for statistical growth for nucleation at or near a surface.
A comparison to recent experimental results demonstrates that the consequences of these effects on the analysis of experimental data in thin films depend on the precise nucleation parameters, and may be small.
Changes on the physico-chemical surface properties and adhesion behaviour of Enterococcus faecalis by the addition of serum or urine to the growth medium
The initial microbial adhesion of bacteria to different surfaces seems to be mediated by physico-chemical forces and this is the reason why the physico-chemical surface characterisation of bacteria has recently gained interest.
In this context, the adhesion of different microorganisms to biological substrata has been described from a physico-chemical point of view, aiming to simulate, as closely as possible, the conditions of interest.
On this basis, the objective of this work is to characterise the surface of Enterococcus faecalis ATCC29212 through hydrophobicity, surface free energy and zeta potential at 37 °C, when cells grow in Trypticase Soy Broth (TSB) and TSB supplemented with serum or urine.
These variations are used to provide a theoretical description of the bacterial adhesion to glass by interaction free energy, which is verified with experimental results employing a parallel plate flow chamber set at 37 °C, to simulate the conditions of flow inside the human body.
The results show that the addition of serum to the growth medium increases the hydrophobicity and isoelectric point (i.e.p.) of the microorganisms, and this could indicate an increase in the protein content on the cell surface.
However urine does not introduce a change in the above magnitudes.
At short separation distances between the cells and the substratum, the interaction free energy predicts a favourable adhesion for serum-grown cells while non-favourable adhesion is expected for control (TSB-grown cells) and urine-grown cells.
These results are in agreement with the experimental adhesion data, obtained with the flow chamber.
Bacterial adhesion to different surfaces is a process that is of importance in many fields.1–3
In particular, in the field of medicine, the adhesion of microorganisms to inert surfaces has gained importance in recent decades due to the increasing number of clinical practices which require the use of implants.
One of the microorganisms of current interest because of its adhesion to such biomaterials is Enterococcus faecalis.
This bacterium is responsible for a great number of nosocomial infections including urinary tract and abdominal infections, wound infections, bacteremia and endocarditis.4,5
The initial adhesion of cells to biomaterials is followed by the formation of a biofilm which, because of its structure, is very difficult to eradicate.6
In these cases, the treatment with antimicrobial agents results in a non-effective therapy.7,8
Therefore, the prevention of the formation of biofilm at its initial stages, seems to be the most promising procedure.
For this reason many papers have studied the initial interaction between microorganisms and different substrata.9–11
It is widely accepted that the initial adhesion of bacteria to biomaterials is mediated by physico-chemical forces similar to those acting in the adhesion of colloidal particles.6,10
In this sense, theoretical predictions of the adhesion process based on interaction free energy calculations have been compared with experimental adhesion results in different investigations.10,12
The positive correlation between both magnitudes could help to predict and consequently control biofilm formation.
The interaction free energy between a particle (in this case bacterium) and a surface is described, from a theoretical point of view, as the sum of the Lifshitz–van der Waals, acid–base and electrical interaction free energies.13,14
This theory, known as the extended DLVO (X-DLVO: Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey and Overbeek), provides the dependence of the interaction free energy with the separation distance.
The long-range Lifshitz–van der Waals and the short-range acid–base forces are obtained through the surface free energy of both interacting surfaces, expressed as the sum of the Lifshitz–van der Waals and acid–base surface free energy components (γLW and γAB, respectively).
Both components are calculated from the contact angles that probe liquids form on lawns of bacteria deposited on filters.
The electrical interaction free energy is obtained from the zeta potential (ζ) of bacteria and substrata.
In relation to bacterial adhesion, there are different methods to quantify the adhesion of microorganisms to biomaterials.
Static and dynamic adhesion-based tests are the most commonly used.10
However, static tests have been criticised because they neglect the conditions of flow that bacteria find in different parts of the human body and because they usually need a biochemical method to permit the count of the adhered bacteria.
This work therefore utilises a flow chamber to carry out the adhesion of E. faecalis to glass, allowing a live observation of microorganisms adhered to solid substrata.
In line with the above explanation, the goal of this work is the physico-chemical characterisation of E. faecalis ATCC29212 through measurements of water, formamide and diiodomethane contact angles and zeta potential determinations at 37 °C.
The incubation of cells is carried out in a standard culture medium (TSB) and TSB supplemented with serum or urine, in order to simulate the physiological conditions in which bacteria cause infections.
The theoretical predictions of the adhesion process of such microorganisms to glass, defined by the X-DLVO, are verified with the adhesion experiments carried out in a parallel plate flow chamber at 37 °C.
E. faecalis ATCC29212 bacteria were stored at −80 °C in porous beads (Microbank, Pro-Lab Diagnostics, Austin, Texas, USA).
From the frozen stock, blood agar plates were inoculated and incubated at 37 °C to obtain cultures.
Bacteria were incubated overnight in 100 ml of urine-free Trypticase Soy Broth (TSB) (BBL, Becton Dickinson, Cockeysville, Maryland, USA) or TSB containing 10% human serum or 50% human urine at 37 °C.
The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 37 °C for 5 min at 1000 g (Sorvall TC6, Dulont, Newtown, Pennsylvania, USA) and washed three times with phosphate buffer saline (PBS, 0.15 mol l−1) for flow experiments and with water (Millipore, Mosheim, France) for contact angle measurements.
Serum and urine were collected from 5 healthy men, between the ages of 20 and 45.
They were pooled and sterilised by filtration employing 0.45 μm pore-size filters (Millipore, Mosheim, Francia) and volumes of approximately 10 ml and 50 ml of sterile serum and urine, respectively were stored at −20 °C in sterile flasks.
Prior to use, the flasks were warmed at room temperature.
Glass (Menzel-Glaser, Braunschweig, Germany) was employed as the substratum for the adhesion experiments in the parallel plate flow chamber.
It was cleaned by sonication for 5 min in 2% v/v commercially available surfactant solution (Vilenet, Vileda Iberica, Barcelona, Spain), rinsed thoroughly with water, sonicated in water for 5 min, and finally inserted in the flow chamber.
The parallel plate flow chamber (dimensions: l × w × h = 7.6 × 3.8 × 0.06 cm) has been described in detail before.15
For enumeration of the adhered bacteria, the flow chamber was placed on the stage of a microscope (Leitz Diaplan, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a 40x ultra-long working distance objective (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) with a numerical aperture of 0.5.
The images obtained from the microscope focussed on microorganisms adhered to the bottom plate of the flow chamber were registered by a CCD camera (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan).
Images were recorded in sets of three images, captured at intervals of a tenth of a second.
Adhered bacteria were identified from non-adhered ones by comparing the three images and counting the fixed bacteria.
An image covered a surface area of 0.025 mm2.
Experimentally, E. faecalis ATCC29212 bacterium grown in TSB or in TSB with serum or urine, were suspended in PBS to a concentration of 3 × 108 cells ml−1 and the suspension flowed through the system at 37 °C for 4 h.
A pulse-free flow (0.034 ml s−1) was created by the hydrostatic pressure, and the suspension was recirculated by a Miniplus 2 peristaltic pump (Gilson, Villers le Bel, France).
During the first 30 min of adhesion, a large number of images were taken to determine the initial deposition rate, after that images were taken every 10 min approximately up to 4 h.
Experiments were repeated at least three times with separately cultured bacteria.
The numbers of adhered bacteria were compared using an unpaired Students t-test.
Changes were statistically significant if P < 0.05.
P gives the probability of observing differences between samples means when the confidence interval selected is of 95%.
Water (Milli-Q Plus), formamide (puriss > 99.0%, Fluka, Switzerland) and diiodomethane (purum > 98%, Fluka, Switzerland) contact angles on lawns of partially dried bacteria at 37 °C without the residual water were determined using the sessile drop technique.16
The values of the Lifshitz–van der Waals (LW) surface tension component (γLW), electron-donor (γ−) and electron-acceptor (γ+) parameters of the acid–base (AB) surface tension component (γAB) of these three liquids at 37 °C are the following: for water γLW = 20.3 mJ m−2, γ− = 25.0 mJ m−2, γ+ = 25.0 mJ m−2, γAB = 50.0 mJ m−2; for formamide γLW = 36.7 mJ m−2, γ− = 38.3 mJ m−2, γ+ = 2.2 mJ m−2, γAB = 18.4 mJ m−2 for diiodomethane γLW = 48.1 mJ m−2, γ− = 0.0 mJ m−2, γ+ = 0.7 mJ m−2, γAB = 0.0 mJ m−2 being calculated in terms of the constant relation for the γ+ and γ− parameters for water.17
Briefly, bacteria suspended in demineralised water were layered onto 0.45 μm pore size filters (Millipore, Molsheim, France) using a negative pressure.
Filters were left to air dry at 37 °C for 45 min.
The time of drying was the time at the “plateau contact angles” (θ) could be measured,17 and has been checked previously.
After that, the filters were introduced in an environmental chamber G211 (krüss, Hamburg, Germany), connected to a thermostat to maintain the temperature at 37 °C.
Before measuring the contact angle with a probe liquid, the chamber was allowed to saturate with vapour of the liquid employed.
Subsequently, the contact angles were obtained analysing the images captured with a computer.
The surface free energy components, γLW, , were calculated from the three-equation system by applying the Young–Dupré equation to each probe liquid (L): where γL = γLWL + γABL is the surface tension of the probe liquid and the subscript B denotes bacteria.
The total interaction free energy, ΔGT, between microorganisms and substrata through water (W) as a function of the separation distance (d) is calculated by the sum of the Lifshitz–van der Waals (LW), the acid–base (AB) and the electrical interaction free energies (ΔGLW, ΔGAB and ΔGEL, respectively) as proposed by the extended DLVO theory (X-DLVO).13,14
These three components are calculated as follows.
Expression of ΔGLW: A is the Hamaker constant, A = −12πd20ΔGLWadh, a is the microorganism radius, d0 the distance of the closest approach between two surfaces and ΔGLWadh is obtained through the Lifshitz–van der Waals surface free energy as follows, subscripts B and S being bacterium and substratum, respectively, and W indicates that surface free energy of the suspending liquid is nearly equal to water.
Expression of ΔGAB: Expression of ΔGEL: ε0 is the dielectric constant of the vacuum and εr the relative dielectric constant of the suspending liquid.
ζB and ζS are the zeta potentials of bacteria and substrata and the subscript S denotes substratum.
Interaction free energies predict favourable adhesion when they are negative and no adhesion when they are positive.
The addition of serum and urine to the growth medium of E. faecalis ATCC29212 involves a series of changes in its physico-chemical surface properties and adhesion behaviour as the following tables and figures indicate.
The first columns of Table 1 contain the water, formamide and diiodomethane contact angles measured at 37 °C on lawns of bacteria grown in TSB (control), TSB with 10% serum and TSB plus 50% urine.
Serum increases the water contact angle of microorganisms which, in terms of hydrophobicity, means that under such a condition E. faecalis becomes more hydrophobic.16,18
On the other hand, urine has no effect on the surface hydrophobicity of the studied bacteria, which remains invariable compared to that of the control, within the experimental error.
The formamide contact angle does not depend on the constituents of the growth medium, while the diiodomethane contact angle only changes for urine-grown cells.
These contact angles of the probe liquids provide, through eqn. (1), the components and parameters of the surface free energy of the cells, which also appear in Table 1.
Serum-grown cells have the highest Lifshitz–van der Waals surface free energy component, but the lowest acid–base surface free energy component, making the total surface free energy in this case very similar to that of the control and urine-grown cells.
The asymmetry found between the electron-donor and electron-acceptor parameters of γAB is very similar in the cases of the control and urine-grown cells and very much higher than that for serum-grown cells.
According to Van Oss et al.,19 this result emphasises the higher hydrophobicity of serum-grown cells compared to the other two samples studied, taking into account that the degree of asymmetry between γ+ and γ− is an indicator of the level of hydrophilicity.
The change that serum introduces in the cellular surface hydrophobicity of cells is in agreement with the results obtained by microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons (MATH method) and recently published by this group.20
In relation to the electrical characterization of the cell surface, the last column of Table 1 presents the values of the zeta potential of bacteria when they are suspended in PBS, a liquid also employed in the adhesion experiments.
The data show that, within the experimental error, the addition of urine to the culture medium produces a very small increase in the effective negative charge on the bacterial surface, while the addition of serum makes the net negative charge higher.
It is interesting to point out that when we say that ζ is a measure of the effective charge, we mean that it measures the electrical potential which one particle manifests when it approaches another particle.
In this context, it is the quantity which characterises the electrical force between the approaching particles, as can be verified below.
Additional information on the surface charge of the microorganisms is provided by the isoelectric point (i.e.p.), which measures the value of the pH when the net surface charge is equal to zero.
Thereby, Fig. 1(a) shows the zeta potential versus pH for the three cases studied, when cells are suspended in KPi—buffer of low ionic strength, with physiological properties and widely used in determining the i.e.p. of biological samples.21,22
When urine is added to the culture medium, the ζ–pH curve is in most cases similar to that of the control, with the exception of those points obtained around pH 3.3.
Nevertheless, serum diminishes the net surface charge of E. faecalis over the entire pH range.
These graphs indicate that the i.e.p.s of control and urine-grown cells are nearly equal (1.9 and 2.0, respectively), while the i.e.p. of serum-grown cells is higher and equal to 2.9.
We also determined the i.e.p. when cells were suspended in the same liquid as that employed in the adhesion experiments, i.e. PBS, a liquid with a higher ionic strength.
The results are presented in Fig. 1(b).
Firstly, it has to be mentioned that the amount of acid or base required to change the pH of PBS suspensions was very much higher than in the case of KPi, due to the higher stability of the buffer PBS.
Despite the fact that PBS makes the curves less pronounced than those obtained with KPi, because of the reduction in the net surface charge of microorganisms (due to the compression of the electrical double layer), the effects of serum and urine on the zeta potential are similar to those observed in the case of KPi.
This means that urine does not introduce important changes in ζ over the entire pH range selected, while serum makes the microbial surface less negatively charged, especially at low pHs.
Based on the curves (Fig. 1(b)), it can be seen that neither the control nor the urine-grown cells have their i.e.p.s in the pH range studied, while the i.e.p. of serum-grown cells is approximately 1.8, a unit less than with KPi, in agreement with the ionic characteristics of both suspending liquids.
The increase in the i.e.p. of serum-grown cells with respect to the control and the invariability of the i.e.p. in the case of the urine-grown cells is positively correlated with the higher and equal hydrophobicity of serum-grown cells and urine-grown cells, respectively, compared to that of the control.
In addition to the previous analysis of the i.e.p. as a magnitude to characterise the electrical behaviour of the cell surface, the i.e.p. value has been related by several authors to chemical components of the bacterial surface such as proteins.11,23,24
It is widely accepted that a direct relation between i.e.p.s and the ratio nitrogen–carbon (N/C, determined by X-ray electron spectroscopy) exists.11,23,24
The explanation is based on the excess of amino groups, NH4+, positively charged, against phosphate groups, PO43−, negatively charged on the bacterial surface.
This picture causes a reduction in the net value of ζ over the pHs, with the consequent increase in the i.e.p..
Some authors11,24 have related the increase in NH4+ groups (and also the i.e.p. increase) with a rise in the number of proteins exposed to the bacterial surface which, due to their hydrophobic character, contributes to an increase in the cellular surface hydrophobicity.
This result is in total agreement with the hydrophobic behaviour of E. faecalis as shown in the first column of Table 1, where serum-grown cells are presented as the most hydrophobic microorganisms.
The effect of serum on the hydrophobicity of the cell surface of enterococci is in agreement with the results obtained by Ljungh and Wadstrom25 when they determined the hydrophobicity of different microorganisms (among them E. faecalis) grown with serum.
Nevertheless, these authors could not attribute the phenomenon to a specific serum compound.
The direct relation between i.e.p. and hydrophobicity found in this work, in addition to the correlations between i.e.p., hydrophobicity and NH4+ obtained by our group and other researchers in previous studies, may indicate that the presence of proteins, contained in serum, on the bacterial surface is responsible for the increase in cellular surface hydrophobicity of serum-grown bacteria.
The main objective when analysing the physico-chemical surface parameters of E. faecalis grown in TSB and TSB supplemented with serum or urine is to check whether they are able to predict the initial adhesion of the microorganisms.
On this basis, interaction free energy, obtained through the above physico-chemical surface parameters, is related to the number of adhered cells discussed in this section.
When a bacterium approaches a surface, the value of the interaction free energy, ΔGT, is a function of the separation distance between both phases, as described by the extended DLVO theory (X-DLVO).
When representing ΔGTversus the separation distance (d) many systems present two minima, one called the secondary minimum (in most cases no higher than 100 kT, k and T being Boltman's constant and absolute temperature, respectively) and the other called the primary minimum, located at shorter distances, much deeper and separated from the secondary minimum by a potential barrier (in the order of some tens of kT).
The state of stable equilibrium corresponds to the primary minimum and the ‘jump’ from the secondary to the primary minimum is relatively easy for cells, which use in their metabolism an amount of energy in the range of 106–108kT.26
When calculating the ΔGT in biological systems to predict non-specific bacterial adhesion, the minimal separation distance (1.57 Å) between cells and substrata is estimated in order to form a new interface.27
This implies that bacteria falls into the primary minimum, an assumption that cannot be completely true if the primary minimum does not exist.
This reasoning led us in this work to take into account not only the value of ΔGT at 1.57 Å but also to draw the ΔGT curves as a function of the separation distances between the interacting surfaces.
The graphics are presented in Figs. 2–4, each relating to one of the samples studied.
At first glance, one can observe the similarity between Figs. 2 and 4, corresponding to control and urine-grown cells, while Fig. 3 appears very different from the others, not only at high separation distances but also when in close approximation (compare Figs. 2(a), 3(a) and 4(a) and Figs. 2(b), 3(b) and 4(b)).
This result is well correlated with all the data belonging to the previously mentioned physico-chemical characterisation of the cells, in which control and urine-grown cells behave in a similar way and differently from serum-grown cells.
On analysing each type of force as a function of the separation distance, Lifshitz–van der Waals interaction free energy governs the interaction between E. faecalis and glass at high separation distances (this is clearly verified from 50 Å for all the cases studied).
At intermediate distances (from approximately 10 Å to 50 Å), the Lifshitz–van der Waals and mainly the electrical force control the sign and magnitude of the total interaction free energy, while at short distances (below 10 Å, see especially Figs denoted with (b)) the acid–base force is the dominant interaction.
With respect to the shape of ΔGT, serum-grown cells exhibit a deep primary minimum (Fig. 2(b)), while control and urine-grown cells lack this potential well.
This fact implies, from a physico-chemical point of view, that serum-grown cells would have a far higher initial adhesion to glass than in the other cases.
The high potential barrier that control and urine-grown cells have at the minimal separation distance means that the bacteria are not able to reach this state and so, from a theoretical point of view, the adhesion to glass of E. faecalis grown in TSB and in TSB supplemented with urine is not possible.
The cells in the last two cases would remain in the secondary minimum, which for the control is about −6 kT and for urine-grown cells −0.5 kT, at distances of 35 Å and 59 Å, respectively, far from the minimal interaction distance required to form a new interface.
In order to validate the theory, the interaction free energy of the adhesion process of E. faecalis to glass should be checked with the experimental adhesion data.
In this sense, Fig. 5 represents the number of adhered cells per square centimetre throughout the adhesion period in a parallel plate flow chamber.
It can be clearly seen that the adhesion to glass of E. faecalis grown with serum is higher than that of the control and urine-grown cells (P < 0.05), the last two cases being mostly similar (P > 0.05).
These adhesion data are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions of adhesion dictated by the X-DLVO theory, in the sense that ΔG values anticipate favourable adhesion to glass of serum-grown cells against the control or urine-grown bacteria.
In these last two cases, adhesion is expected to be similar between them and lower than serum-grown cells.
The present study brings to light that components of serum modify the physico-chemical surface of E. faecalis by enhancing its hydrophobicity, isoelectric point and by changing the components and parameters of the surface free energy.
Such changes predict a favourable adhesion to glass taking into account the X-DLVO theory, which is in agreement with the experimental adhesion data.
On the other hand, the supplementation of the culture medium with urine does not produce any effect on the hydrophobicity and surface charge of microorganisms, as shown by the similar adhesion curves obtained for this sample and that of the control.
This work can help to deepen in the knowledge of the infections by E. faecalis, which in the last decades has become an important nosocomial pathogen.
Its ability to modify its physico-chemical properties in the presence of serum, favouring its adhesion to inert surfaces, could, for example, explain the importance of enterococcus in endocarditis.
Moreover, enterococcal infections of the urinary tract could be related to other kinds of forces, different from physico-chemical interactions.
This last point remains unclear and warrants further investigation.
Regular Liesegang patterns and precipitation waves in an open system
We investigate the regular and moving Liesegang pattern formation phenomena in an open system.
First, simulations have been performed at fixed coupling between the reactive medium and the reservoir, later this control parameter was varied during the simulations resulting in various phenomena.
We predicted and monitored for the first time various—dynamically changing—precipitation structures and a spatial hysteresis phenomenon, which is beyond the scope of the Turing instability.
The dynamics of the reaction is well detectable using specific quantities: the total amount of precipitate and its center of gravity.
Detailed investigations of homogeneous chemical systems showed that phenomena like bistability, complex and chaotic oscillations may exist only in open chemical systems, far from thermodynamic equilibrium.1,2,3
The appropriate experiments are carried out using a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR).
In 1952, Turing predicted that the diffusion of species may destabilize a homogeneous chemical system producing stationary patterns in a spontaneous way.4,5
The pioneering work of De Kepper and his coworkers provided for the first time an experimental evidence for the formation of Turing patterns.6
Up to the last decade, a wide range of spatial or spatiotemporal reaction–diffusion patterns (such as complex Turing patterns, phase waves, autocatalytic chemical fronts, etc). have been designed and investigated also in open systems. 7,8
Formation of the precipitation patterns in the wake of diffusion driven chemical fronts has been extensively studied from the end of the 1800’s.9,10
This is the first chemically designed and controlled spatiotemporal pattern formation.
Although the generation of such patterns (called Liesegang patterns) is quite easy, the research on this topic still has a great relevance.
In the typical experimental setup, one chemical reagent is uniformly distributed in a gelled medium (called inner electrolyte, B), while the other one (called outer electrolyte, A) diffuses from outside.
The initial concentration of A is chosen to be much larger than that of B. This condition ensures the higher diffusion flux of the outer electrolyte into the gel.
The coupling of the diffusion and the precipitation reaction between the two chemical components produces a non-soluble precipitate (AB) in the reaction front.
The distribution of the precipitate is usually non-uniform behind this front.
Appearing precipitation zones (Liesegang bands or rings, depending on the geometry of the experimental setup)11–19 have several empirical regularities (time, 20,21 spacing,22 and width law23–25), in which some well-measurable quantities are connected with each other.
These are Xn, the position of the nth band, measured from the junction point of the electrolytes, tn the appearance time, and wn, the width of the nth band, respectively.
The Matalon–Packter law describes the dependence of the spacing coefficient (P = Xn+1/Xn) on the initial concentration of the inner and outer electrolytes.26–28
Recently, a new and more general law has been proposed, which also includes advective dynamics in the reactive medium.29
For this, two new quantities are introduced: ptot, the total amount of precipitate and Xc, the position of the center of gravity of precipitation system measured from the junction point of the electrolytes.
Besides the theoretical derivation, experimental and numerical evidences confirmed the new law, which states that ptot is linearly proportional to Xc.29
From the beginning of the last decade, more and more complex precipitation pattern formation scenarios have been studied and discussed.30,31,34–36
Several authors reported that the precipitation process followed by complex formation of precipitate may produce moving Liesegang patterns (“moving” bands)34–36 or moving precipitation pulse (precipitation waves).12,30–33
In several papers, deterministic chaotic time oscillation of the total number of bands,35,37 effect of an electric field on pattern structure,12,38 and crossover from the precipitation waves to moving Liesegang patterns39 have been investigated.
These are the recent trends in the study of the precipitation pattern formation phenomena.
Das et al. presented the Liesegang pattern formation in 2D using a gel-ring reactor, in which the two electrolyte solutions were fed from reservoirs13: The outer electrolyte was fed continuously from the center, while the inner one from a gel ring outside the reaction medium.
Several years ago Bhattacharya et al. proposed a model, which included a single autocatalytic reaction step followed by nucleation and growth.40
Based on the fact that a cubic autocatalytic step coupling with CSTR may give rise to Turing patterns,41 they demonstrated formation of spatially periodic precipitation patterns.40
In classical experimental setup, the diffusion front of the outer (invading) electrolyte depletes the inner electrolyte from the reactive medium due to the precipitation reaction.
The aim of this paper is to provide for the first time a systematic investigation of the regular and moving Liesegang pattern formation in an open system, where a continuous feeding of the inner electrolyte is allowed.
To illustrate our idea, we have chosen the simplest precipitation mechanism (1 : 1 type, AB), giving rise to precipitation patterns, according to the reactionA(aq) + B(aq) → AB(s),where A and B yield the outer and inner electrolytes, respectively, while AB is the precipitation product.
In addition, the precipitate reacts with the excess of the outer electrolyte, producing a soluble complexAB(s) + A(aq) → A2B(aq).For simplicity, we supposed that the formed complex A2B is stable, so the reverse step was neglected.
Due to the irreversible step the stable complex does not affect dynamically the pattern formation.
Therefore, it was supposed that neither the complex nor the precipitate diffuses.
A sketch of our system appears in Fig. 1 where for a clear visual interpretation we provide a 2-D description.
In fact, the thickness of the reactive medium is negligible and therefore, the reaction is described using only horizontal coordinates.
The dimensionless governing equations for the reactive medium, coupled with a well-mixed reservoir for the inner electrolyte (open system) in 1-D arewith τ and x being the time and length coordinates, respectively.
Here a, b, c, and p denote the concentrations (or even density for solid phase) of the outer and inner electrolyte, the complex, and the precipitate, respectively.
Da and Db are the diffusion coefficients of the corresponding species, while b0 is the concentration of the inner electrolyte in the reservoir (CSTR).
k is the reaction rate constant for the complex formation (eqn (2)).
κ is related to the coupling between the reactive medium and CSTR, which maintains a continuous mass flux of the inner electrolyte.
κ is the inverse of the residence time of species in the reactor, which can be accurately controlled by the flow rate.
The function Δ(ab, K, L) (will be specified later on) describes the precipitate formation based on Ostwald’s supersaturation theory.
Despite its simplicity and generality this concept provides a perspicuous mechanism in many cases, where the precipitation process plays a partial role.
The efficiency of the above mentioned precipitation mechanism was tested by simulating the effect of an electric field,42,43 stochastic precipitation pattern formation,44 and also moving Liesegang bands and precipitation waves.37
The term kpa in eqns (3), (5) and (6) represents the complex formation rate, whereas κ(b0 − b) in eqn (4) describes the coupling between the reactive medium and the reservoir.
However, it should be noted that the immobilization of the complex is not a necessary condition for the moving pattern formation.
To describe the precipitation formation presented by the simple mechanism (1) we choose the model proposed by Büki et al.,45,46 which is based on the Ostwald’s ion-product supersaturation theory.47
The precipitation reaction term Δ(ab,K,L) is defined as follows: where k0 is the rate constant of the precipitation reaction (1), K is the nucleation product, L is the solubility product, and Θ is the Heaviside step function.
The coefficient Sp is related to the extent of the supersaturation of the system and influences the intensity of the reaction.
Formally, Sp is calculated using the equation (a − Sp) (b − Sp) = L. As far as ab ≤ L we do not need to define it, since the precipitation reaction term in (7) is zero, anyway.45,46
The precipitation reaction continues at a certain point x until the concentration p in x has reached a threshold pmax.
Numerical simulations were performed using a “method of lines” technique.
Discretization of eqns (3)–(6) was carried out on a 1-D equidistant grid applying a second-order finite difference scheme.
In this procedure, at any fixed time the functions a,b,c and p in (3)–(6) are substituted with vectors [a(τ, x1), a(τ, x2),…,a(τ, xn)] and similarly for b, c and p, respectively, where x1,x2,…,xn are the grid points.
The spatial differential operator turns to be a matrix of dimension n × n and with this, (3)–(6) can be approximated by a system of ordinary differential equations (of size n) with respect to time.
This has been solved using a second-order Runge–Kutta method with the following initial conditions:a(0,x) = a0Θ(−x), b(0,x) = b0Θ(x), p(0,x) = c(0,x) =0.The boundary condition is no flux type both for the inner and the outer electrolyte at the end of the reactive medium.
It is Dirichlet type a(t,0) = a0 for the outer electrolyte at the junction point of the electrolytes.
Although both κ and b0 could be used as control parameters of the system, b0 was fixed in the simulations.
This concentration has been chosen to coincide that of the initial concentration of B in the reactive medium.
The presented model allows to describe the crossover from Liesegang patterns to precipitation waves using only one parameter: in case of k = 0 regular Liesegang pattern formation, and for k ≠ 0 moving patterns are expected.
In all simulations, we used the parameter set Da = Db = 1.0, K = 0.15, L =0.1, k0 = 1.0, and pmax = 50.0.
The grid spacing was Δx = 1.0, and the numerical simulations were performed with the time step Δτ = 0.01.
First, the dependence of pattern structure on the coupling coefficient (κ) has been investigated in the case of regular Liesegang patterns (k = 0), and precipitation wave (k = 10−3).
Obviously, if κ = 0 (there is no coupling between the reactive medium and reservoir), then regular Liesegang pattern and precipitation wave evolve, and the final pattern will depend on the particular parameter set.
If κ ≫ 0, a single precipitation zone develops, starting from the junction point of the electrolytes instead of the (regular or moving) Liesegang patterns, due to the high flux of the inner electrolyte from the reservoir.
This extremely high coupling reduces and slightly modifies the purely diffusive profile of the invading (outer) electrolyte A. This intensive coupling ensures that the product of the local concentrations is kept above the nucleation product (K), therefore, the precipitate is formed continuously.
Fig. 2a,b shows the final pattern structure for fixed values of κ.
Results of the numerical experiments are in good agreement with the above explanation.
In the case of the precipitation waves, increasing κ results in a thicker precipitation zone, the final position of which is getting more and more close to the junction point.
Increasing κ promotes the precipitation reaction, thus reduced concentration of the outer electrolyte puts back the complex formation.
In contrast to the case of precipitation waves, we predict regular Liesegang patterns for small values of κ, and a single precipitation zone for relatively high values of the control parameter.
The time law for the regular Liesegang patterns (even for 1-D or planar ones) states that the position of each band is linearly proportional to the square root of its formation time.
This is a consequence of the diffusive dynamics of the invading electrolyte.
In several cases, modification of the dynamics (including the presence of external electric field, advection field, curvature effect) results in some deviations compared to the time law.20
Fig. 3a presents the evolution of the pattern for various values of κ.
Relatively high coupling hampers the depletion of B, therefore, the more intensive precipitate formation reduces the concentration of A in the reactive medium, which leads to the slower evolution of the pattern.
Similarly, the center of gravity of the precipitation system (Xc) exhibits slower motion in time as depicted in Fig. 3b.
The total amount of the precipitate ptot and the center of gravity of the precipitation system Xc are defined as follows:where L is the length of the 1-D reactive medium.
At the same time, the enhanced reaction rate increases the total amount of precipitate (ptot), the evolution of which has been plotted in Fig. 3c.
Note that increasing the coupling coefficient affects more significantly ptot than Xc.
In this way increasing κ, dependence of ptot on Xc exhibits an accelerating growing rate (Fig. 3d).
In the regular 1-D case, in all of the subfigures of Fig. 3 one can observe a linear dependence.
Moreover, this linear dependence in Fig. 3d is also valid in the case of an additional advective flux in the system29.
Up to this time, the control parameter (κ) was fixed at certain values during the numerical experiments.
Now we will focus on the behavior of the system with the coupling rate between the reactive medium and reservoir being varied on a continuous scale: various time dependences of κ have been applied.
Accordingly, variation of the total amount of the precipitate (ptot) and the center of gravity of the precipitation system (Xc) is depicted in Fig. 4 as a function of log κ.
The change of log κ was linear on [nT, (n + 1)T] with integer values of n.
We give the exact time dependence of log κ as follows:which allows to illustrate clearly its effect on the distribution of the precipitate, where T is the time period of one cycle.
All simulations were started at κ = 10−9, which corresponds to a very weak coupling.
Increasing κ results in an increased amount of the precipitate due to the enhanced mass-flux of the inner electrolyte from the reservoir into the reactive medium.
The maximum of ptot is attained at the maximal rate of the coupling (κ = 1 in the simulations).
Similarly, ptot is decreasing when the coupling coefficient κ is decreased (Fig. 4a).
One can observe a slightly different behavior of the center of gravity with varying κ.
The position Xc is an increasing function of κ up to a certain coupling coefficient, afterwards, Xc is decreasing (Fig. 4b).
Decreasing κ from the maximum to its minimum value, Xc monotonically increases.
At the first stage, when the coupling is weak, a precipitation wave travels in the reactive medium.
In the case of higher coupling, the precipitate formation behind the pattern will dominate compared to the precipitate dissolution by complex formation.
At the same time, the precipitate formation is stopped in front of the pattern, because the coupling and precipitation reaction behind it reduces the concentration of the invading electrolyte.
Therefore, Xc is shifted backward, however, the total amount of precipitate increases continuously.
The complex formation of the precipitate has a more significant role behind the pattern, when the coupling rate is decreased.
The same applies to ptot, while Xc increases.
At weak coupling, the precipitation process continues in front of the precipitation wave and the wave evolves further.
The most interesting scenario observed during the simulations is the hysteresis of the pattern.
Accordingly, one can observe the hysteresis of the quantities ptot and Xc related to the pattern.
The time oscillation of ptot is a trivial consequence of the variation of κ in time, but the hysteresis is a unique feature.
Note that similar hysteresis curves (with different maxima) belong to different time dependent functions of κ.
Hysteresis occurs due to the interaction of the reaction rate (for the precipitation and complex formation), diffusion of the electrolytes, and the coupling rate.
When increasing κ, the dominant process is the precipitate formation behind the pattern due to the high coupling, which reduces the diffusion of the invading electrolyte.
When decreasing κ, the precipitate formation process diminishes behind the pattern, and the evolution of the pattern will be driven by complex formation.
This process may be accompanied with the precipitate formation in front of the pattern, if the diffusion profiles of the outer electrolyte are regenerated.
In the simulations, we varied κ periodically over some periods (Fig. 5).
We observed that the values of ptot corresponding to the maximal and minimal values of κ have been increased, compared to those of the first period.
An interesting feature (using a given parameter set) of the observed system is that after the first loop, a periodic change of κ results in the periodic change of total amount of the precipitate.
Analyzing the evolution of Xc while varying the time dependent κ in the same way, a similar behavior of the center of gravity has been found.
Fig. 6 presents the evolution of the precipitation wave over four periods.
Position of the front and back section of the wave and the center of gravity exhibit a forced time oscillation according to the change of κ.
Time dependence of the back section of the wave has different dynamics whenever the variation of log κ (in time) was linear, while decreasing or increasing this control parameter.
Note that the thickness of the precipitation zone is related to the total amount of the precipitate, therefore both of them exhibit the same behavior.
In this study, we have investigated the regular and moving precipitation pattern formation in an open system using a CSTR for the coupling of the inner electrolyte between the reactive medium and reservoir.
Evolution of patterns in both cases, and the distortion of the existing laws (time and “universal” laws) due to the coupling coefficient have been investigated.
The coupling of the inner electrolyte between the CSTR and the reactive medium has a great impact on the pattern structure.
Variation of the coupling coefficient (κ) during the individual simulations resulted in a unique behavior for the moving precipitation wave phenomenon: the pattern structure and the corresponding characterizing quantities, the total amount of the precipitate (ptot) and the center of gravity (Xc) have hysteresis.
This new result is a unique observation on this research field.
Compared to the Turing patterns which are stationary ones, the above investigated moving precipitation wave phenomenon in an open system represents dynamic patterns.
The spatial hysteresis of the Turing patterns has been known for more than one decade.
The novel result of our study is that we observed the hysteresis phenomenon in a precipitation system, which qualitatively differs from activator–inhibitor or cubic autocatalytic systems, where Turing patterns have been reported.
The coming step in our study is to design the experimental setup to validate our new predictions.
Are Hartree–Fock atoms too small or too large?
We address the simple question, whether Hartree–Fock atoms are smaller or larger than exact (Schrödinger) atoms.
As a measure, we use 〈r2〉.
We study the ground state of the atoms He–Kr.
The unrestricted Hartree–Fock method is used.
To obtain the Schrödinger values we use the finite field CASPT2 approach, and the full CI scheme where possible.
CASSCF calculations are also reported.
Very large basis sets are employed.
We find that for those atoms for which the CASSCF wavefunction is distinct from the HF wavefunction, the Schrödinger values are distinctly smaller than the HF values.
Most other atoms are also smaller than the HF values, (or the same within a numerical uncertainty), the exceptions being the hard atoms N–Ne, and Cl, Ar and Kr.
We interpret our results in terms of categories of correlation contribution.
It is also of interest to test the performance of density functional theory (DFT); we find on the whole that the predictions are good, with B3LYP giving close agreement with finite field CASPT2 for nearly all atoms, in particular for the transition metals.
One of the outstanding problems of computational quantum chemistry is the understanding of electron correlation.
The correlation energy is defined as the difference between the Hartree–Fock energy and the exact (non-relativistic) energy of the molecule.1
It is often separated into two parts, a short range effect due to the reduction in probability as two electrons come together, and a long range effect which is often responsible for electrons proceeding correctly to their atoms as the molecule dissociates.
The first part is called ‘dynamic correlation’, and is often associated with the necessity of including the interelectronic distance rij in accurate wavefunctions.
The importance of the electron–electron cusp is a dynamic correlation effect.
Quantum chemical calculations often introduce dynamic correlation through the introduction of ‘double replacement configurations’ into a configuration interaction (CI) expansion, although excluding double replacements into anti-bonding or non-bonding orbitals.
Dynamic correlation is often thought to be associated with a reduction in size because it allows electrons to arrange themselves in the most efficient manner possible.
The second part is called ‘left–right correlation’ for obvious reasons, but it is equally well called ‘static correlation’ or ‘near-degeneracy correlation’ or ‘non-dynamic correlation’.
Quantum chemists introduce this correlation through the introduction of double replacement configurations which involve anti-bonding or non-bonding or other valence orbitals.
Such correlations are responsible for an increase in molecular size: indeed for diatomic molecules, Hartree–Fock (HF) often predicts too short bonds, with CI calculations correctly lengthening them.
We deduce that this correlation has a greater effect on molecular shape than dynamic correlation.
The great difficulty is that in quantum chemistry these two forms of correlation cannot be cleanly separated.
For H2, the dominant double replacement CI configuration is σ2g → σ2u, which is clearly a left–right effect, but as the bond length decreases it becomes 1s2 → 2p2 in united atom notation, which is a dynamic effect.
It is often proclaimed that the correlation in atoms is all dynamic, because there are no long-range correlations.
The assignment is not clear for Be for which the near-degeneracy configuration 1s22p2 is very important, and this is commonly called ‘static correlation’.
Alternatively it may be argued that this configuration introduces r2ij and it is therefore a dynamic effect.
We recognise that angular correlation can be interpreted as an effect of r2ij.
Similar arguments can be presented for other atoms, where (ns)2→(np)2 are possible, for example the carbon atom ((2s)2 (2p)2,3P→(2p)4,3P), and the transition metals with a filled ns shell in the ground state.
Intuitively one might think these Hartree–Fock atoms are too large, because angular correlation should make them smaller (less screening).
On the other hand radial correlation could make them bigger, since one of the electrons moves to the next shell.
It is therefore relevant to ask the question whether HF atoms are too large or too small.
We attempt to ascertain the true size of atoms by performing CASSCF,2 CASPT23 and full CI (FCI) calculations using large basis sets.
We study the ground states of all atoms in the first three rows.
In all our investigations we shall calculate 〈∑i r2i〉, r2i = x2i + y2i + z2i, as a measure of atomic size.
Results from these investigations are given in section 3.
The tail behaviour of the wavefunction gives information on size.
The asymptotic behaviour of the exact density is exp(−2(2I)1/2r), whereas the asymptotic behaviour of the HF density is exp(−2(−2εhomo)1/2r).
If −εhomo>I, then the HF atom may be too small and vice-versa.
Indeed this analysis agrees with later results in this paper.
However we doubt whether the tail behaviour tells us about size because the emphasis should be on those regions where the electron density is high.
There are more accurate values of 〈r2〉 for selected small atoms, but they will not give a systematic comparison.
Density functional theory (DFT) introduces correlation effects rather differently.
The correlation functionals for the uniform electron gas, ascribed to Volko, Wilk and Nusair (VWN)4 or Perdew and Wang (PW91)5 are called dynamic correlation functionals, because there are no near-degeneracy configurations in that model system.
Perdew has extended his functional to include density gradients (P91).6
The functional LYP7 is also called a dynamic functional, because it was derived from the He correlated wavefunction of Colle and Salvetti (CS),8 basing one’s argument on the fact that all correlation in that atom must be dynamic.
It is also of the generalised gradient approximation (GGA) form.
It is well-known from many molecular calculations that these functionals do not introduce all molecular correlation; for example for N2, it is found9 that LYP (or P91) only introduces ∼50% of the necessary correlation for molecular binding.
Furthermore self-consistent Kohn–Sham (KS) calculations with HF+LYP (HFLYP) predict bondlengths which are even shorter than HF bondlengths.
The remarkable success of DFT hinges upon the fact that local exchange functionals introduce a localised exchange hole, which is close to the reference electron, in contradiction to the HF model which favours delocalised exchange holes.
The most popular local exchange functionals are the original uniform electron gas functional due to Dirac (LDAX) and the GGA exchange functional of Becke (B88X).10
The functional B88X introduces the other ∼50% of the correlation for the binding of N2; for these reasons it is said to introduce left–right correlation.
Such an analysis has been shown to work in practice for many hundreds of molecules.
Calculations with BLYP often successfully lengthen the too-short HF bondlengths.
The geometrical effects of the exchange functional are more significant than those of the dynamic functional.
B88X contains one parameter β, which was determined so that the exchange energies of the atoms He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe at the HF level were optimally reproduced.
For these noble gas atoms therefore, Becke believed that all the correlation should be dynamic.
Therefore one can ask the question, is dynamic or non-dynamic correlation more important for the determination of atomic size, in this DFT terminology?
Because the GGA functional BLYP is known to be good, we can analyse separately the contributions from B88X and LYP.
We therefore perform investigations using the LDA and BLYP functionals.
We first perform Hartree–Fock calculations and Kohn–Sham calculations, because of their similarity and simplicity.
For these single reference (one electron in each spin orbital) calculations, we have chosen to use the basis set which yields the lowest Hartree–Fock energy.
For all the calculations in this section we have used the unrestricted algorithm, because this is the proper procedure for KS calculations (see for example Pople et al11.), and therefore for comparison we should compute UHF energies.
The basis set used is due to Partridge12, which of course is appropriate for the occupied orbitals only.
All calculations were performed within CADPAC, with ∫ ρ(r)r2 dr being calculated using high radial quadrature.
The open shell atoms in many cases are not spherically symmetrical (eg C 2pαx 2pαy), but the values obtained would be the same if the atom was spherically symmetrised.
All orbitals are real.
We perform calculations on the atoms H-Kr; relevant ground states are Sc(d1s2,2D), Ti(d2s2,3F), V(d3s2,4F), Cr(d5s1,7S), Mn(d5s2,6S), Fe(d6s2,5D), Co(d7s2,4F), Ni(d8s2,3F), Cu(d10s1,2S), Zn(d10s2,1S).
In Fig. 1 we plot percentage ratio values of 〈∑ir2i〉 (denoted as r2 in our discussions) for the local exchange LDAX (Dirac) and the GGA exchange B88X10 functionals, compared to the UHF values.
In Fig. 2 we show the percentage ratio for the local LDA (LDAX+VWN) and the GGA BLYP exchange–correlation functionals.
Fig. 1 shows that the LDAX atoms are larger than the B88X atoms, for H through Ar, but for the heavier atoms there is little percentage difference.
B88X atoms are larger than UHF atoms for H-Li, B-Ne, Al–Ar, Cr, Ga–Kr.
The introduction of dynamic correlation through the correlation functionals reduces atomic size, see Fig. 2.
We see that LDA and BLYP atoms are similar in size; only He, C–Ne, BLYP atoms are substantially larger than UHF atoms, with S-Ar and Se-Kr marginally larger.
DFT is suggesting that most Schrödinger atoms are smaller than UHF atoms, with the clear exception of the hard first row atoms, and He, P–Ar, Se–Kr.
It will be seen below that these predictions are in agreement with those from ab initio quantum chemistry calculations.
These we now report, and then in the final section we will compare the two sets of calculations, and give our explanation for the results.
Calculations have been performed using ANO-L basis sets13 for the atoms He-Zn with the exception of K and Ca for which a relativistic basis set (ANO-RCC)14 was used (designed for use with the Douglas–Kroll Hamiltonian).
Slightly smaller values of 〈r2〉 were consequently obtained for these two atoms.
The ANO-L basis sets were not available for Ga–Kr.
Instead, a smaller ANO-S basis set15 was used.
Comparison of the HF results shows that also this basis set is adequate for the present purpose.
The details of the basis sets are: AtomsPrimitiveContractedHe9s4p3d2f5s4p2dLi–Ne14s9p4d3f6s5p3d1fNa–Ar17s12p5d4f7s6p4d2fK21s16p5d4f10s9p5d3fCa20s16p6d2f10s9p6d2fSc–Zn21s15p10d6f4g8s7p5d3f2gGa–Kr17s15p9d9s9p5d
The active space used in the CASSCF calculations2 comprises all valence orbitals: 2s,2p for atoms Li–Ne, 3s,3p for Na-Ar, 4s,4p for K–Ca, 3d,4s,4p for Sc–Zn and 4s,4p for Ga–Kr.
CASSCF is therefore identical to restricted open-shell HF (ROHF) for the atoms: He, Li, N–Ne, Na, P–Ar, K, Cr, Cu, and As–Kr.
Spherical symmetry is assured by performing the calculations in Ci symmetry and averaging over the components of a given term.
The wave functions are of course eigenfunctions of the spin operator Ŝ2.
The CASPT2 calculations3 are performed using the G1 correction to the zeroth order Hamiltonian.
A small imaginary level shift (0.05) was used for the transition metals.
The outermost core electrons were included in the correlation treatment (specifically 1s for Li–B, 2s,2p for Na-Ar, 3s–3p for K–Zn, and 3d for Ga–Kr).
The 〈r2〉 values have been obtained using finite field perturbation theory (FFPT).
The method was calibrated by controlling it to give the same result as the expectation value for CASSCF wavefunctions.
Full CI (FCI) calculations were also performed for the atoms He–N and Mg–P.
The results are quite similar to FFPT/CASPT2, which is reassuring.
The calculations have been performed using the MOLCAS-6.0 software.
The percentage ratios for FFPT/CASPT2 (denoted PT2) r2 values compared to UHF have been given in Fig. 2.
Fig. 3 gives the percentage ratios for FFPT/CASPT2 and the hybrid functional B3LYP16.
In order to calibrate the present results with those obtained using UHF and the Partridge basis set in section 2, we first compared the r2 values with the ROHF results obtained using the CASSCF method.
The appropriate atoms for this comparison were listed above.
There were no notable differences for the atoms Li–Ar and As–Kr, (indeed less than 0.05 a20).
The difference is marginally larger for K (0.20 a20), which could be due to the different basis sets used.
For the other atoms CASSCF is not identical to ROHF.
The reason is that in these cases there are important intra-valence correlation effects due to excitations from the doubly occupied ns shell to the empty (for the transition metals) or partially empty (for the main group atoms) np shell.
We have collected the results for these atoms in the Table 1.
Also the the hybrid DFT functional B3LYP16 and the FFPT/CASPT2 results are presented in this table.
(For completeness we give the FFPT values for the atoms not in the table: H 3.00, He 2.39, Li 18.45, N 12.20, O 11.39, F 10.49, Ne 9.62, Na 26.65, P 30.09, S 29.12, Cl 27.68, Ar 26.13, K 47.64, Cr 36.60, Cu 31.01, As 40.74, Se 41.04, Br 40.48, Kr 39.55).
We now see a clear difference between the UHF and CASSCF results.
The latter are constantly smaller and the difference is larger the more empty the p-shell.
This difference was anticipated in the introduction and can be easily understood.
The s2 → p2 excitation introduces angular correlation between the s-electrons, which increases the probability to find the two electrons in different sides of the atom.
The separation of the electron pair leads to a decreased screening of the core and the atom shrinks.
The DFT functionals attempt to correct for this error in the UHF density.
This is quite successful.
The atom-sizes for BLYP are close (in the majority of cases) to the results obtained with FFPT/CASPT2.
Comparing to the full CI results we see that DFT/B3LYP slightly overcompensates (except for Mg), while the FFPT/CASPT2 results are quite similar to the FCI results.
Indeed the B3LYP predictions are very close (in magnitude) to the FFPT/CASPT2 predictions.
Finally, the overall effect of static correlation is to decrease the atomic size!
The effect is particularly pronounced for transition metal atoms.
However both atoms with large intra-valence correlation effects (eg V) and those with none (eg Cr) decrease in size on including dynamic correlation effects through introducing PT2 to CASSCF.
We conclude that dynamic correlation reduces atomic size.
Therefore both the static and the dynamical correlation effects lead to a decreased size of the atoms.
The effect is largest for atoms with large static correlation effects.
Within the scope of the present calculations, we are now able to answer the posed questions.
Firstly, most Schrödinger atoms are smaller than the UHF atoms.
For He, Li, C, S, Cl, Ar, Se, Br and Kr the sizes (〈r2〉) are the same within numerical accuracy (estimated to be 0.1 a20).
N (0.13), O (0.17), F (0.24) and Ne (0.25) are indicated to have larger Schrödinger atoms than UHF atoms (the values in parenthesis are the differences in 〈r2〉).
But these differences are small.
In the cases for which the CASSCF wavefunction is distinct from the HF wavefunction, the Schrödinger atoms are significantly smaller than the HF atoms (see the table, C is the exception).
Angular correlation therefore reduces atomic size.
For the hard atoms N–Ne, there is no s2 → p2 excitation, and thus radial correlation is more important, leading to an increase in size for these atoms.
For the second row it is probable that angular correlation is introduced through the 3d orbitals, leading to the difference with the first row atoms, but radial correlation becomes dominant for Cl and Ar.
In the third row radial correlation only dominates for Kr.
The summary is that these size differences reflect the balance between angular and radial correlation effects.
The predictions from DFT are in general in good agreement with the predictions from FFPT/CASPT2.
In particular the predictions with B3LYP are within 0.3 a20 for nearly all atoms (exceptions are Li, Be, B, Na, Mg, Ca and Cr), in particular the transition metal atoms are very well predicted (except Cr).
The predictions with BLYP are a little inferior, but they are superior to the predictions of CASSCF, as might be expected.
On the role of the CP47 core antenna in the energy transfer and trapping dynamics of Photosystem II
The CP47–RC complex of photosystem II (PS II) has an antenna subunit of 16 chlorophyll a molecules attached to the reaction center (RC) at the side of its inactive branch.
The X-ray structure of PS II revealed that the shortest interpigment distances between CP47 and RC are about 21 Å, which is two-three times larger than within each subunit.
Such long distances may slow down the energy transfer from CP47 to RC.
In order to evaluate the influence of the CP47 antenna on the energy transfer and trapping dynamics in the RC we performed a comparative analysis of CP47–RC and RC complexes from spinach by transient difference absorption and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy at room temperature.
Our data reveal a complex multiexponential decay of the excited states in both complexes.
The main trapping lifetimes are 2–3, 30–40 and 360–460 ps in the RC and 2–6, 80–85 and 650–700 ps in the CP47–RC, the latter two phases being two to three times longer than in the RC.
The data could be fitted well with a kinetic model consisting of three reversible radical pair states, the first one being nearly isoenergetic with P680*, and identical energy levels and kinetics of processes occurring within the RC in both complexes.
We conclude that there is no kinetic limitation of the energy transfer between CP47 and RC on the two slowest trapping phases and that this transfer occurs in 20 ps or less.
The two factors that influence the observed slower trapping in CP47–RC are the highly reversible charge separation reaction in the RC and the presence in CP47 of states with energy lower than the primary electron donor P680.
In the thylakoid membranes of green plants, algae and cyanobacteria the reaction center (RC) of photosystem II (PS II) is surrounded by a number of pigment-protein complexes that harvest sunlight and efficiently deliver excitation energy to the RC.1
The subunits most close to the RC are CP43 and CP47, which together with the RC and a number of extrinsic proteins involved in water oxidation constitute the PS II core complex.
Structures of cyanobacterial PS II core complexes were obtained recently at 3.5–3.8 Å resolution.2–4
The main features of the cyanobacterial structure match reasonably well those of green plants, so it is valid to use the X-ray structure of PS II from cyanobacteria as a model for the structure of the PS II core complex of higher plants.5
According to the X-ray structure the RC (D1/D2/Cyt b559) complex comprises 8 chlorins and 2 carotenes, all of which participate in the energy transfer and/or electron transfer processes.
Four chlorophyll (Chl) and two pheophytin (Pheo) molecules are arranged in two branches in the central part of the complex.
One branch is known to be active in charge separation.9
Two Chl molecules are bound at the periphery of the complex at distances of about 24 Å from the core pigments and do not participate in the primary charge separation process, though they can be involved in secondary electron transfer processes, just as the two β-carotene molecules and cytochrome b559.6
The CP47 complex contains 16 Chls and two β-carotenes.4
In the thylakoid membrane it is located at the side of the inactive branch of the RC.
The closest interpigment distance between CP47 (Chl43 according to the nomenclature in ref. 2) and RC (PheoD2 and ChlZD2) is about 21 Å, which is considerably more than the ca. 9 Å average interpigment distance in CP47.
In all PS II RC preparations obtained thusfar the secondary electron acceptors, the plastoquinones QA and QB, were removed from their binding sites during the isolation procedure, implying that photochemistry does not proceed beyond the primary radical pair.
The CP47–RC complex differs from the RC mainly by the presence of the additional antenna subunit, because QA is also largely absent after isolation and purification.7
This means that these two complexes represent a good target for comparative studies of the influence the CP47 core antenna on the energy transfer and charge separation processes in the RC.
The kinetics of energy transfer and trapping in the RC have been studied by several groups using both ultrafast absorbance difference and fluorescence techniques.
The results were reviewed elsewhere.8,9
According to these studies the transfer of excitation energy within the six central chlorins of the RC is ultrafast, with a time constant of about 100 or 600 fs upon excitation into the blue or red edge of the Qy absorption band, respectively,10 though slower energy transfer components can probably not be excluded, in particular at low temperatures.11
It was suggested12 that charge separation occurs from an excited state which at least at room temperature is distributed over a significant fraction of the six core chlorins, depending on the particular realisation of the disorder.
The charge separation reactions are strongly multiphasic, with main components in the range of 0.4–3, 20–50 and 120–500 ps.
The details of charge separation process are not precisely understood yet, especially with regard to the role of the “accessory” Chl on the active branch of the RC (ChlD1 according to the nomenclature in ref. 2).
It has been proposed that at least at low temperatures ChlD1 acts as primary electron donor and that the ChlD1+ PheoD1− pair occurs first, followed by electron transfer from PD1 to ChlD1+.13
The findings that ChlD1 is the red-most absorbing chromophore in the PS II RC14 and that PheoD1 and ChlD1 give rise to a charge-transfer state of about equal energy with those of the main exciton states15 are in line with this idea.
Lifetimes of about 0.4, 3 and 8 ps were suggested for the primary charge separation.8,9
The 20–50 ps processes were interpreted as formation of a secondary radical pair or primary charge separation limited by the slow transfer from the peripheral Chls to the core of RC.16–20
The 200–500 ps kinetics, initially attributed to radical pair relaxation due to electron transfer to QA,21 were also observed in isolated RC preparations, which do not contain QA.22
It was proposed that the slow relaxation reactions of the radical pair may be induced by conformational changes of the protein, induced by the creation of the two charges.23
Recent experiments indicated that most of the energy transfer dynamics in CP47 occurs within 2–3 ps.24
In CP47 the lowest energetic state absorbs at 690 nm with an oscillator strength equal to that of 1 Chl.
The 690 nm state gives a major contribution to the low temperature emission of CP47 and determines a 17 ps lifetime of energy transfer in CP47 at 77 K. The 690 nm pigment is most probably located at the periphery of CP47 not close to the RC and its population will slow down rather than speed up the energy transfer to the reaction center.25
For PS II core complexes it was initially proposed21,26 that excitation energy equilibrates rapidly within several hundreds of femtoseconds between the core antenna and the RC, and that then charge separation occurs within several picoseconds (trap-limited model).
Earlier fluorescence measurements performed on CP47–RC and larger PS II particles27,28 supported the fast energy equilibration between core antenna and RC.
In contrast, calculations of energy transfer rates29 performed on the basis of the recently published PS II structures suggested slow energy transfer from the core antenna to RC, even though most of the Chls in the core antenna are oriented in a way favourable for efficient transfer to the RC.30
The lifetime of charge separation depends in this case on the slow energy delivery process from the core antenna to the RC (transfer-to-the-trap-limited model).
In this contribution we present room temperature transient absorption and time-resolved fluorescence studies on PS II RC and CP47–RC complexes purified from spinach.
Our goal was to record the energy transfer and trapping processes in RC and CP47–RC under similar experimental conditions to be able to make a reliable comparison of the obtained results.
The results indicate that the presence of the CP47 antenna reduces the rate constants of trapping by a factor of 2–3.
A fit based on a kinetic model suggests that the slower trapping observed in CP47–RC is caused by a shift of the excited states distribution towards the CP47 antenna, and that the intrinsic rate for energy transfer from CP47 to RC does not limit the overall trapping kinetics in the CP47–RC complex.
PSII RCs were purified from spinach Tris-washed “BBY” grana membranes31 as described by van Leeuwen et al.32
CP47–RC complexes were purified from spinach as described elsewhere.7
For the spectroscopic measurements, all samples were diluted in a buffer containing 20 mM Bis-Tris (pH 6.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM CaCl2 and 0.03% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (β-DM).
Semi-anaerobic conditions in the samples were created by addition of catalase, glucose and glucose oxidase, in that order, to final concentrations of 120 μg ml−1, 10 mM and 120 μg ml−1, respectively.
The optical density (OD) of the samples used for the transient absorption and fluorescence measurements was about 0.7 mm−1 and 0.8 cm−1, respectively, at the Qy absorption maximum.
The steady state absorption of the samples was compared before and after measurement.
Sample degradation was in all cases less than 1%.
We also analyzed the CP47–RC complex before and after measurement by diode-array-assisted gel filtration chromatography.33
This technique allows a quantitative estimation of the amount of free CP47 and free pigments in the samples.
The results revealed a contamination of free CP47 complexes of 1% or less in the samples and no measurable amount of free chlorophylls (not shown), suggesting no significant contribution of unbound CP47 or free chlorophylls to the observed kinetics.
Absorption difference spectra were recorded with a femtosecond spectrophotometer, described in detail elsewhere.34
In brief, the output of Ti:Sapphire oscillator (Coherent Mira) was amplified by means of chirped pulse amplification (Alpha-1000 US, B. M. Industries), generating 1 kHz, 800 nm, 60 fs pulses.
Single-filament probe white light was generated in a 2 mm sapphire plate.
Pump light at 400 nm was obtained by doubling the 800 nm fundamental via a SHG crystal.
Pump light in the visible wavelength range was produced in a home-built, noncollinear optical parametric amplifier.
After prism compression, the pulse duration was reduced to 50–60 fs.
Interference filters with transmission maxima at 662 and 695 nm and fwhm 12 and 15 nm, respectively, were used to select the wavelength of excitation.
Transient absorption difference spectra were collected with probe and excitation beams oriented at magic angle.
The excitation beam was focused in a spot with 350 μm diameter.
The energy of excitation was 15 nJ pulse−1 upon 662 and 695 nm excitations, and 30 nJ pulse−1 upon 400 nm excitation.
We estimated that about 0.25–0.5 photons were absorbed by each complex per laser shot upon 400 nm excitation, and 0.1–0.2 photons per complex upon 662 and 695 nm excitations.
The cuvette (1 mm pathlength) was shaken in order to refresh the sample from shot to shot.
The time resolution was typically 120 fs and the spectral resolution was 3 nm.
The data were corrected for white light group velocity dispersion and instrument response, and fitted globally as described in .ref. 35
A coherent coupling between pump and probe pulses36,37 was included into the fit function for the data obtained upon 662 and 695 nm excitations.
Time-resolved fluorescence emission spectra were recorded with a Hamamatsu C5680 synchroscan streak camera as described in .ref. 38
In short, the output of a Ti:Sapphire oscillator (Coherent Mira-Rega), generating 125 kHz, 800 nm, 150 fs pulses, was doubled via an OPA (Coherent), producing 125 kHz, 400 nm, 150 fs pulses.
A 665 nm light was generated via the OPA (Coherent) and selected with the interference filter with fwhm = 5 nm.
The sample was placed in a spinning cell (diameter 10 cm) with rotation frequency of 75 Hz.
The excitation energy was 1–2 nJ/pulse and the excitation beam was focused in a spot with 150 μm diameter, corresponding to about 0.05–0.1 absorbed photons per complex.
Fluorescence was collected at magic angle with respect to the polarization of the excitation beam.
The time resolution was 3.5 ps for 400 nm excitation and 6 ps for 665 nm excitation, the spectral resolution was 5 nm.
The fluorescence data were corrected for white light group velocity dispersion and instrument response, and fitted globally as described in ref. 38.
Fig. 1 shows room temperature absorption spectra of the isolated RC and CP47–RC complexes.
The Qy absorption band peaks at 675 and 675.5 nm for the RC and CP47–RC respectively.
The Qy absorption band of the RC is highly congested, though there is some evidence that the peripheral Chls contribute more to the blue side of the Qy absorption (670–675 nm),17,39 and that most of the six central chlorins of the PS II RC absorb at around 680 nm.40
Thus, some selectivity can be achieved upon applying different wavelengths of excitations.
The Qy band of isolated CP47 overlaps fully with that of the PS II RC and is even broader than this spectrum due to the presence in CP47 of Chls absorbing at energies higher and lower than those of the RC.
Thus selective excitation of one of subunits within CP47–RC can not be achieved.
The different lineshapes of the two preparations in the Soret region is explained by the relatively higher content in the RC of Pheo a and cytochrome b-559, which both have strong absorbances at 416 nm33.
Transient difference absorption spectra of RC and CP47–RC were measured on a time scale up to 4 ns upon excitation into the Soret band of Chl a (λex = 400 nm), and the blue and red edges of the Qy absorption band (λex = 662 and 695 nm, respectively).
The decay-associated difference spectra (DADS) obtained after global analysis are shown in Fig. 2.
The decay of delta absorption in the PS II RC complex could be fitted reasonably well with five components for 662 and 400 nm excitation and three components for 695 nm excitation.
The first DADS has a lifetime of about 100 fs and has a very different shape for the three wavelengths of excitation.
Upon 400 nm excitation it has a strongly positive amplitude (Fig. 2e), indicating that excited states of Qy absorption bands are populated during this time.
This phase can therefore be attributed to Soret to Qy relaxation processes.
The first DADS upon 662 nm excitation (Fig. 2c) has a negative peak at 670 nm and a positive peak at 683 nm.
The conservative shape suggests energy transfer from species absorbing maximally at 670 nm to species absorbing maximally at 683 nm.
Subpicosecond equilibration processes in PS II RC complexes were observed and extensively discussed before.10
This fast equilibration must almost exclusively occur within the six central chlorines of the PS II RC, because there is evidence that the peripheral Chls transfer energy to the central pigments on a much slower timescale (10–30 ps).
The second DADS has a lifetime of about 2–3 ps and has similar, but not identical shapes upon different wavelengths of excitation.
For 400 and 695 nm excitation it consists of a negative band peaking at about 683 nm and a positive band around 660–670 nm.
For 662 nm excitation, the negative band is slightly blue-shifted while no positive band between 660 and 670 is observed.
We attribute this phase to primary charge separation.
Merry et al10. reported a 600 fs uphill energy transfer in PS II RC complexes upon 694 nm excitation, which was better resolved in data with a parallel orientation of pump and probe beams.
It is possible that uphill energy transfer contributes to the 2 ps DADS in our magic angle data upon 695 nm excitation, but that it could not be resolved as a separate, 600 fs component.
The shape of the 2 ps DADS obtained upon 400 and 695 nm is similar to the 3 ± 1 ps DADS obtained upon 543 nm excitation into the Qx band of Pheo a (data not shown).
This gives evidence that Pheo contributes to the absorption around 680 nm and also confirms that Pheo participates in the initial charge separation process.
The third DADS has a lifetime of about 20–30 ps and has a negative amplitude in the whole Qy range, except for a positive feature around 680 nm upon 662 and 400 nm excitation.
The negative contribution in the red edge of this DADS for a large part is due to the decay of stimulated emission.
Stimulated emission must occur from excited states, implying that excited states still contribute to the observed absorption changes on the tens of ps timescale, in line with the fluorescence measurements (see below).
The positive feature around 680 nm may occur as a result of several processes: energy transfer from peripheral chlorophylls peaking at 670 nm, electrochromic bandshifts caused by the positive and negative charges associated with PD1+ PheoD1− formation, like in the bacterial RC,41 and a blueshift of red exciton states caused by PD1+ PheoD1− formation.
Excitation at 695 nm will prevent the first possibility, and the absence of the positive 680 nm feature upon 695 nm excitation suggests that energy transfer from peripheral chlorophylls at 670–680 nm states gives an important contribution to the overall kinetics.
The fourth DADS has a very small amplitude in transient absorption, and has a lifetime of about 360–460 ps.
This phase was not observed upon 695 nm excitation, which could be due to its small amplitude.
This phase has a prominent amplitude in the fluorescence decay (see below), and can therefore be attributed to radical pair relaxation.
The non-decaying (ND) absorbance within the time range of our experiments has a minimum at 680 nm and is positive at wavelengths longer than 700 nm, which is an indicator of presence of the PD1+PheoD1− radical pair, the final product of charge separation.18
It is known that in the isolated RC the radical pair has a lifetime of about 50 ns at room temperature,42 which then recombines to the ground state or the P680* singlet or triplet state.
Its shape is identical upon all wavelengths of excitation.
The global analysis revealed six, five and four components for CP47–RC upon 400, 662 and 695 nm excitation (Fig. 2b, d, f).
The first DADS (80–180 fs) have similar shapes as those observed in the RC and similar origins: Soret to Qy energy transfer for 400 nm excitation and energy equilibration between 670 and 680 nm absorbing species for 662 nm excitation.
It is likely that the latter phase occurs not only in the RC, but also within CP47, because in isolated CP47 a strong 200 fs energy transfer from 670 to 680 nm absorbing species was found (at 77 K).24
In all traces one or two transients were found with lifetimes of 2–6 ps.
These lifetimes most probably reflect a mixture of at least two processes: downhill energy transfer within CP47, as was shown to occur at 77 K,24 and charge separation within the RC (like the 2.5 ps component in the RC).
It is also possible that energy equilibration between CP47 and RC contributes to this phase.
The shapes of the 2–4 ps phases are similar to those of the corresponding phases in the RC, which suggests that direct charge separation within the RC contributes to a significant extent to these phases.
The 6 ps phase upon 400 nm excitation has a shape consistent with downhill energy transfer within CP47.
The third series of DADS have lifetimes of 75–90 ps and have roughly similar shapes as those of the 20–30 ps DADS in the RC, exept for the large negative feature caused by CP47 excited states.
The negative amplitudes suggest that they all reflect a recovery of bleach, caused by a conversion of chlorophyll/pheophytin excited states into their oxidizes/reduced states.
These DADS can therefore be attributed to the secondary trapping process, which in CP47–RC has an about threefold increased lifetime.
A fourth series of DADS have lifetimes of 750–1000 ps.
The amplitudes of these DADS are larger than those in the RC, and the lifetimes are two to three times longer.
It is likely that a third step of radical pair relaxation contributes to these decays.
The fact that these DADS are larger than in the RC can be explained by the fact that due to the presence of CP47 about 3x more excited states remain before this phase occurs.
For all excitation wavelengths, the non-decaying (ND) components have similar shapes as those observed for the RC, and thus reflect the absorbance difference spectrum of the PD1+ PheoD1− radical pair.
From the results of this section we conclude that in both complexes multiexponential trapping by charge separation occurs.
The lifetimes of trapping are about 2–3, 23–30 and 360–460 ps for the RC and 2–4, 70–90 and 700–1000 ps for CP47–RC.
The last two processes are about three times longer in CP47–RC than in the RC.
Fig. 3 shows the steady-state emission spectra of RC and CP47–RC at room temperature which peak at 681 and 683 nm, respectively.
Isolated CP47 peaks at 683 nm.44
The 2 nm red shift of the CP47–RC emission maximum is consistent with the fact that CP47 makes a significant contribution to the emission of the CP47–RC complex.
We have measured time-resolved fluorescence spectra of RC and CP47–RC upon 400 and 665 nm excitation, using a streak camera set-up.
This technique allows a better time and spectral resolution than the more commonly used single-photon timing technique, and was used before for an analysis of RC complexes with red excitation (F. van Mourik et al., manuscript in preparation).
For our experiments, the time resolution was 3.5 ps for 400 nm excitation and 6 ps for 665 nm excitation.
This was not sufficient to resolve subpicosecond processes with similar accuracy as in pump–probe experiments.
Experimental traces are shown in Fig. 4.
It is obvious from these pictures that CP47–RC is characterised by a longer decay of the emission than RC.
The decay associated emission spectra (DAES) for RC and CP47–RC are shown in Figs. 5 and 6.
Apart from a poorly resolved sub-picosecond transient, four components were needed to fit the fluorescence decay of the RC for 400 and 665 nm excitation (Figs. 5a and 6a, respectively).
The first DAES has a lifetime of about 3 ps, and peaks considerably (400 and 695 nm excitation: F. van Mourik et al., manuscript in preparation) or slightly (665 nm excitation) more to the red than all subsequent decay phases.
The DAES for 400 nm excitation has a positive peak at 690 nm and a small negative feature at 672 nm.
The shape of this DAES is non-conservative (with a large positive and a small negative part).
The large positive part (decrease of fluorescence) reflects the trapping by charge separation from states emitting around 685–690 nm.
The small negative part can be explained by uphill energy transfer.
The following DAES have positive amplitudes and lifetimes of 39 and 360 ps, and reflect subsequent processes of trapping by charge separation.
This subsequent trapping could only be observed in fluorescence measurements when excited states are still present in the complex, i.e. if trapping is intrinsically multi-exponential.
One possible cause for multi-exponentiality is that trapping is reversible and that the initially formed radical pair ‘relaxes’, which will causes a decrease of excited states population resulting in a decrease of fluorescence.
The 39 ps DAES upon 400 nm excitation and the 400 ps DAES upon both excitation wavelengths are similar in shape compared to the steady-state emission of the RC, suggesting that at least the 400 ps processes occur from excited states equilibrated over all pigments.
Comparison of the 40 ps DAES upon 400 and 665 nm excitation (Fig. 7) reveals that this DAES upon 665 nm excitation has a larger contribution in the blue part around 670 nm.
This suggests that the 40 ps trapping process occurs from a non-equilibrated state and thus can be a mixture of at least two processes: slow energy transfer from (peripheral) chlorophylls absorbing around 670 nm, and trapping by the formation of a secondary radical pair.
The 400 ps DAES contributes significantly to the emission of the RC, consistent with radical pair relaxation.
The last DAES have a lifetime more than 15 ns which can be attributed to the lifetime of radical pair.
The DAES obtained for CP47–RC upon 400 and 665 nm excitation are shown in Figs. 5b and 6b, respectively.
The first DAES has a lifetime of about 5 ps, but a very different shape for both excitation wavelengths.
Upon 665 nm excitation, it has a positive peak at 675 nm and negative peak at 695 nm, consistent with energy transfer within CP47.
The non-conservative character of this DAES suggests that trapping also occurs on the same time scale.
Upon 400 nm excitation, the shape of this component is similar to the 3 ps component in the RC.
Its amplitude, however, is smaller than that of the next DAES in the CP47–RC complex.
This phase must be largely due to charge separation.
The following two DAES have positive amplitudes and reflect trapping by charge separation with lifetimes of about 80–85 ps and 650–700 ps.
These times are similar to those observed in transient absorption, and the amplitudes suggest that both processes contribute about equally to the trapping.
The large amplitudes of these DAESes suggest that the decay of CP47 excited states largely contributes to these components.
The last DAES has a lifetime longer than 15 ns which can attributed to the lifetime of radical pair.
The analysis of the time-resolved fluorescence and transient difference absorption data allowed us to make the following conclusions.
In the PS II RC complex, the excitation energy is rapidly (about 100 fs and less than 2–3 ps upon excitation in the blue and red edges of the Qy absorption band, respectively) redistributed among the central six pigments of the RC between states absorbing at around 670 and 680 nm.
Then the initial trapping process occurs with a timeconstant of 2–3 ps.
The following 30–40 ps process is a mixture of at least two: secondary radical pair formation and transfer of excitation energy from blue-shifted Chls.
A 360–460 ps trapping phase can be assigned to further radical pair relaxation.
The relaxed radical pair lives longer than 15 ns.
In CP47–RC, the first trapping phase takes place on the 2–6 ps timescale, but its kinetics can not easily be followed because of the presence of a major energy transfer process within CP47 in the same time range.
Also energy transfer between CP47 and RC can in principle occur on this timescale.
Just as in the RC there are two subsequent trapping phases.
Both are about three times longer in CP47–RC than in RC.
Thus, the addition of the CP47 antenna results in a lengthening of the two slow phases in excited state decay by a factor of about three.
These experimental observations can be explained in at least two ways: (1) the intrinsic rate constant of energy transfer between CP47 and RC is slow due to long distances between the pigments of CP47 and RC; this slow transfer would slow down the subsequent process of trapping in the RC, and (2) the intrinsic rate constant of energy transfer between CP47 and RC is fast, while the excited states distribution is shifted towards CP47 because of red-absorbing states.
The equilibration of the excited states over a larger antenna will then cause the slower trapping lifetimes observed in the experiments.
These two possibilities can be summarized as transfer-to-the-trap-limited and trap-limited kinetics, respectively.
For the RC, we used a model with five compartments (Fig. 8a).
Compartments ‘A*’ and ‘RC*’ correspond to the average excited state energy levels of blue 670 Chls and bulk 680 chlorins, respectively.
The former may correspond to the two distant Chls in the RC; the latter to the six central chlorins of the RC core.
Compartment ‘RP1’ represents the energy level of the first radical pair.
The subsequent relaxations of the radical pair are represented by the compartments ‘RP2’ and ‘RP3’.
For simplicity, we discard fast equilibration within the RC core, and thus assume that charge separation takes place from a state equilibrated over all core pigments.
We only modelled the fluorescence data upon 665 nm excitation.
All compartments are connected by forward and backward energy transfer.
The back transfer rate was calculated via the Boltzmann factor: kji = kij(Ni/Nj)exp(−Δij/kT), in which Ni is the number of chlorophylls in compartment i, Δij is the energy difference between compartment i and compartment j, k is Boltzmann’s constant, T is the absolute temperature.
The losses including emission are expressed via the value kfl−1 which is of the order of the lifetime of fluorescence of free Chl.
The total emission decay is proportional to the sum of decays of populations of excited states ‘A*’ and ‘RC*’.
In order to exclude the influence of apparatus response functions on the experimentally measured kinetics, we used data obtained from global analysis of the fluorescence measurements, and integrated over all wavelengths.
The latter simplification is justified, because apart from the 2–3 ps phase all decay components have similar spectra.
The model presented in Fig. 8a gives a good fit of the fluorescence decay in the PS II RC.
The fit for the 665 nm excitation data is shown in Fig. 9a.
The parameters of the fit are listed in Table 1 together with the reciprocal eigenvalues obtained from the solution of the master equation describing the model.
The reciprocal eigenvalues are close to the time constants obtained in the experiment.
Values of 25.7 and 37.4 ps can not be resolved separately, and give a single value of 23–30 ps in pump–probe and 39 ps in fluorescence.
The energy gap between ‘A*’ and ‘RC*’ is 284 cm−1, assuming that blue Chls and bulk chlorins absorb maximally at 670 and 683 nm respectively.
Slight changes in these energy levels did not significantly influence the fit.
We assumed that ‘RC*’ and ‘RP1’ are nearly isoenergetic.
Slightly higher or lower energy levels for ‘RP1’ relatively to ‘RC*’ did not increase the quality of the fit.
The two subsequent relaxations give an energy differences between ‘RC*’ and the final charge separated state ‘RP3’ of 76.5 meV.
This value has been measured to lie between 46 and 110 meV.23,43–46
The fact that the initial radical pairs are not much below the excited state in free energy explains why the emission can be observed over such a long time window.
The contribution of each compartment of the model to the total decay of emission is shown in Fig. 10a.
It is clear from the picture that ‘RC*’ and ‘RP1’ fully equilibrate in about 180 ps.
After that the populations of the both states remain similar.
The contribution of the blue chls (compartment ‘A*’) to the total decay is essential only up to about 100 ps.
For the CP47–RC we added an additional compartment ‘B*’ (Fig. 8b) corresponding to the average energy level of CP47. ‘B*’ is reversibly connected with the compartments ‘A*’ and ‘RC*’.
In this case compartment ‘A*’ corresponds to the average energy level of only one distant Chl from RC, the closest to CP47.
The total emission decay is proportional to the sum of decays of populations of excited states ‘A*’, ‘B*’ and ‘RC*’.
The fit of CP47–RC fluorescence upon 665 nm excitation is shown in Fig. 9b.
For the processes occurring within the RC, we used the same energy levels and rate constants as found for the isolated RC complex.
The parameters of the fit and the eigenvalues are listed in Table 2.
To obtain a good fit of the experimental data it was necessary to set level ‘B*’ lower in energy than ‘RC*’.
A small energy gap of 42.9 cm−1 (see Table 2) still allows efficient uphill energy transfer from ‘B*’ to ‘RC*’ at room temperature.
Furthermore, a good fit of the data can only be obtained if the intrinsic rate constant of energy transfer from CP47 to RC is sufficiently fast.
We found an upper limit for this transfer rate of (20 ps)−1.
Slower rates result in a too slow decay of the excited states, which can only be corrected for by changing the energy levels of the secondary and tertiary radical pairs in the RC.
The contribution of each compartment to the total decay of the emission is shown in Fig. 10b.
The ingrowth of population of each radical pair in CP47–RC is now much slower than in RC, which is because the excited states distribution is shifted towards CP47.
The main conclusion of this section is that good fits of the excited state decay can be obtained by a reversible radical pair model coupled to two subsequent relaxed radical pair states.
If the energy levels of the three radical pairs do not change as a result of the addition of CP47, then the energy transfer between CP47 and RC does not limit the overall kinetics.
The slowing down of the trapping kinetics upon the addition of CP47 is explained by a shift of the excited state distribution towards CP47.
The analysis of transient difference absorption and time-resolved emission data revealed a multiexponential decay of the excited states in the PS II RC.
Typical trapping lifetimes in the RC are 2–3, 30–40 and 350–450 ps.
Multiexponential trapping in the PS II RC was also observed in earlier experiments, as well as in CP47–RC (this work) and PS II core preparations.47
Initially it was thought that the wide spread of trapping times is due to sample heterogeneity and/or to a wide distribution of the free energy difference of radical pair formation.
Later it was suggested that radical pair formation induces a reorganization of the protein surroundings, which in turn reduces the energy level of the radical pair.23
Also secundary electron transfer reactions, e.g., from PD1 to ChlD1+, may reduce the free energy of the radical pair.
Our data are consistent with the following model.
Excitation energy rapidly equilibrates within the six central chlorines of RC.
Some or most equilibration takes place in about 100 fs, the remainder within a few ps at most.
Then initial charge separation takes place in 2–3 ps.
The red shifted position of the 2–3 ps component in the transient absorption (400, 695 and 543 nm excitation) and time-resolved emission (400 and 680 nm excitation) indicates that initial charge separation starts from a red exciton state in the RC.
This was already suggested in the literature based on the low temperature photon echo,13 site-directed mutagenesis,14 Stark spectroscopy15 and pump–probe measurements.48
It is most likely that the first radical pair consists of the ChlD1+PheoD1− pair.13–15
The first charge separation generates a radical pair state of about equal energy as that of the singlet excited state of the primary electron donor.
This makes recombination back to excited state highly possible.
After charge recombination the excitation is equilibrated over all central chlorines in RC.
This defines the blue shift (relatively to the 2–3 ps DAS) of the 30–40 ps component in fluorescence which is observed at 400, 665 and 680 nm excitation.
The process of energy transfer from the peripheral Chls also contributes to this phase.
It is possible that the 30–40 ps trapping phase originates from electron transfer from PD1 to ChlD1+, thus creating the PD1+PheoD1− radical pair.
If this interpretation is correct, then this process would be considerably slower than in the purple bacterial RC, where this process takes place in about 3 ps.
It would also mean that the 3 ps phases in the RCs of PS II and purple bacteria have different origins.
The third trapping lifetime on the 350–450 ps time scale can be interpreted by a lowering of the energy level of PD1+PheoD1− radical pair due to conformational changes of the protein surroundings.
The fact that this phase, rather prominent in the time-resolved emission experiments, gives rise to only very minor absorbance changes is consistent with this idea.
The data of the X-ray structures2–4 indicate that the chlorophylls of CP47 are located at considerable distances from the chlorophylls and pheophytins of the RC.
The shortest distance is 21.3 Å, between Chl43 of CP47 and PheoD2 of the PS II RC.
This will lead to slow energy transfer between CP47 and RC, also because the excitation energy will be rapidly delocalized over the 16 Chls of CP47 and the six central Chls and Pheos of the PS II RC.
Thus, one should expect to observe this component as a relatively slow phase in the time-resolved spectroscopy data.
We indeed observed slower lifetimes for the excited states decays in CP47–RC.
However, the data analysis based on the kinetic model leads to the conclusion that the intrinsic time for energy transfer from CP47 to RC does not limit the trapping kinetics.
According to this analysis, the upper limit for this transfer is about 20 ps.
This analysis was based on the assumption that the energy levels and rate constants between the various compartments was identical for processes within the RC in the PS II RC and CP47–RC preparations.
In other words, charge separation is assumed to occur in identical ways in both preparations.
While there is no solid experimental evidence that would argue in favour or against this assumption, it does reflect the most simple model for charge separation in PS II.
An upper limit of about 20 ps was defined for the intrinsic time constant for energy transfer from CP47 to the RC.
Only a few ‘linker’ chlorophylls from CP47 are directly coupled with the RC chlorines via energy transfer.
To obtain the time constant of energy transfer between the coupled pigments the value 20 ps must be corrected for the number of Chls in CP47 and the number of ‘linker’ chlorophylls, which gives 2.6 ps assuming 16 Chls in CP47, two of which are ‘linker’ Chls.
This value is of the order of the general equilibration time in the CP47 antenna.
It may become slightly longer if the excited states of the ‘linker’ chlorophylls are populated to a larger extent than expected from a random distribution, for instance because they are red-shifted or are involved in exciton states that delocalize the main exciton state predominantly on these chlorophylls (which would also be caused by their relatively low site energies).
According to the X-ray structures, the linker chlorophylls are ideally oriented for energy transfer to PheoD2,30 supporting our conclusion about the fast rate of this process.
We calculated the difference between energy transfer rates from the nearest linker chl of CP47 (Chl43) to PheoD2, and from ChlZD2 to PheoD2, based on the Förster formula.
The shorter distance and the more favorable orientation of the first pair of molecules suggests a ten times faster energy transfer rate from Chl43 to PheoD2, in agreement with the parameters of our model.
We note, however, that local differences in refractive index can have a significant influence on these rates.49,50
Because the charge separation in the RC is highly reversible and the rate of excitation equilibration between CP47 and the RC is fast, the excited states of the CP47 antenna remain populated all the time the excitation occurs in the CP47–RC complex.
The spectral properties of the CP47 antenna are also very important.
The fact that the average energy level of CP47 is lower than that of the RC helps to distribute the excited states towards the core antenna.
We have found that the intrinsic rate constant of energy transfer is of the same order as the initial rate of charge separation.
These results indicate that energy transfer and trapping in CP47–RC is not transfer-to-the-trap limited, as it is in the purple bacterial RC-LH1 complex.51
However, it is also not really trap-limited, because some of the energy transfer processes occur on the same timescale, or are even slower than that of the primary charge separation reaction.
A unique property of Photosystem II is that it has a high oxidation potential.
It would be reasonable to assume that to prevent oxidation of the antenna components and leaking away of the positive charge from the site of water oxidation, these components must be located at long distances from the RC.
The available structural data have shown that the CP47 chlorophylls are indeed located at distances of 21 Å or more.
Our analysis, however, has shown that this does not prevent a fast excitation energy transfer between CP47 and RC, highlighting the light-harvesting function of CP47.
It is also clear that CP47 does not play a direct role in the stabilization of the charge separation.
Crucial roles in the charge stabilization are currently explained by electron transfer, in the 20–30 ps time range, from PD1 to ChlD1+ and by conformational changes, in about 300 ps, of the charged protein surroundings.
At high light intensities, the rate of photosynthetic electron transport reaches a maximum.
This leads to changes in the PS II antenna system which ultimately give rise to a strongly increased decay of excited states via internal conversion into heat by a process known as non-photochemical quenching52 and by photodestruction of the D1 protein of the PS II RC.53
Our results indicate that CP47 reduces the apparent rate constant of charge separation and acts as a temporary excitation storage system.
The excited levels of CP47 gradually contribute to the ingrowth of radical pair populations.
It is likely that the other PS II antenna complexes play similar roles.
So, the fast rate constant of energy transfer between CP47 and RC helps to keep the excitation energy in the antenna system and the possibility to regulate the light need for PS II by means of the antenna.
This means that the antenna has a dual function: (1) it increases the absorption cross-section, i.e. it increases the amount of collected light; and (2) it reduces the oversaturation of energy transfer chain.
We remark that these properties are not unique for PS II.
It was shown recently that the additional IsiA antenna attached to iron-stressed cyanobacterial PS I performs similar functions: an increase of the light-harvesting capacity of PS I,54,55 and at the same time photoprotection for PS II56.
The effect of hydrogen-bonding on the ultrafast electronic deactivation dynamics of indigo carmine
Excited-state dynamics and mechanisms of the rapid deactivation process of indigo carmine (InC) were investigated by means of femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and steady-state Raman spectroscopy.
Solvent dependence of the excited-state lifetime revealed that intermolecular hydrogen-bonding with the solvent molecule is more effective than the intramolecular ones to accelerate the deactivation process.
Steady-state Raman spectra in the low-frequency region indicated a loss of molecular planarity in protic solvents.
It was concluded that the hydrogen-bonding in the excited state, which leads to the twisting around the central CC bond and/or to the out-of-plane deformation, was of crucial importance in the rapid deactivation.
Indigo is one of the natural dyestuffs utilized by human beings from the dawn of civilization.
The description “indigo” can refer either to the blue dyestuff obtained from several species of plants, or to the chemical compound accountable for the color.
In this report, it represents the latter.
The Nobel Prize in 1905 was awarded to a German research chemist, A. von Baeyer, for the synthesis and the structural formulation of indigo.1,2
Influenced by this success, search for artificial indigo derivative with superior chemical properties took place and the first artificial derivative, thioindigo, was synthesized in .19063
It is well known that thioindigo and other indigo-derivatives shown in Scheme 1 (a) undergo photochromism, i.e., reversible trans–cis isomerization around the central CC bond on photo-excitation.4–9
However, for indigo (X = NH) itself, photo-isomerization and/or the cis-form have never been observed.
On the basis of the peculiar molecular structure enabling intramolecular hydrogen(H)-bonds between the two adjacent pairs of carbonyl and NH groups,10–13 two possibilities were considered as the origin of the absence of photo-isomerization; (1) double intramolecular H-bonds “lock” the molecular structure in planer trans-form, or (2) intramolecular proton-transfer from the NH group to the carbonyl group occurs on the excited state prior to the isomerization, which leads back to the trans-configuration in the ground state.14,15
For highly fluorescent thioindigo, it is generally accepted that trans → cis isomerization takes place through triplet intermediate.15–21
It was concluded that the planar trans configuration is in thermal equilibrium with the twisted configuration in the T1 state.20
T1 state is also considered to be the intermediate in the case of N,N′-dimethylindigo.22
Intersystem crossing is usually a slow process which can be inhibited by a faster reaction channel.
Elsaesser and coworkers have carried out time-resolved picosecond fluorescence and IR spectroscopy of 4,4′,7,7′-tetramethylindigo, a indigo derivative that can form intramolecular H-bonds.23
They concluded that proton transfer does not occur in the first excited electronic state from the following experimental results, (a) their time-resolved IR spectra revealed that the NH stretching in the S1 state was shifted to lower frequency only by 40 cm−1 compared to the ground state, (b) no evidence of a transient OH band was found around 3200 cm−1 in the excited molecule, (c) the CO stretching mode at 1640 cm−1 remained virtually unchanged upon photo-excitation and (d) the steady state fluorescence spectrum was Stokes shifted only by 900 cm−1 which was rather too small for a fluorescence form a proton transferred tautamor which can be as large as ∼10 000 cm−1.
Although, there are many reports on excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) taking place from phenolic –OH group to the H-bonded adjacent –N group, i.e., 2-(2′-hydroxy-5′-methylphenyl)benzotriazole,24,25 2-(2′-hydroxyphenyl)benzothiazole,26,27 and 10-hydroxybenzo[h]quinoline,28 we could not find any report on ESIPT from NH group to CO group.
Intramolecular H-bond forming 5- or 6-membered ring is considered to be strong, because of the good overlap of the molecular orbitals.29
If the isomerization of indigo is blocked by the intramolecular H-bond bridge, formation of intermolecular H-bonds with the solvent may break the bridge and lead to photo-isomerization.
However, addition of alcohols to the solution of photochromic indigo dyes is known to quench the fluorescence and diminish the isomerization.30–32
It was concluded that intermolecular H-bond opens a rapid nonradiative deactivation channel to the trans-formed ground state by transferring the energy to the solvent bath through the H-bond.30
In the case of indigo, which is only weakly fluorescent, intramolecular H-bonds are suggested to provide a channel for the rapid radiationless deactivation.32,33
For 4,4′,7,7′-tetramethylindigo in chloroform, the fluorescence lifetime was only 30 ps and the overtones of the NH stretching mode and the out-of-plane deformation mode were considered to be the decay channels for the rapid internal conversion.23
Another H-bonded system that exhibits rapid nonradiative decay without formation of any detectable intermediate is the intermolecular H-bonded 1-pyrenol-pyridine system.34
It was concluded that, immediately after the electron-transfer form 1-pyrenol to pyridine, a large scale and ultrafast proton shift takes place which induces an ultrafast nonradiative crossing to the ground state.
Hydrogen-bonding is one of the most important topics in chemistry and in molecular biology.
H-bonds in the excited state are known to mediate not only proton transfer but also electron transfer.35,36
However, the role of H-bonds in energy deactivation and dissipation is not well understood.
The ultrafast deactivation channel of indigo can be utilized as a model of energy dissipation and related structural reorganization in much complicated H-bonding systems.
It is needless to say that H-bonds determine the structure and dynamics of protic liquids like water as well as of biopolymers like protein and DNA.
Here we report a study on ultrafast deactivation process of indigo carmine (InC) to elucidate the relation between deactivation dynamics and intra-/intermolecular H-bonding.
InC is a trans-indigo derivative which can form intramolecular double H-bonds as shown in Scheme 1(b).
We have chosen this molecule because of its high solubility in protic solvents compared to indigo.
It is also reported that InC forms solute/solvent complexes with methanol and water because of its solvent dependence of the absorption and emission spectrum.37
Solvent dependence of the excited state lifetime was carefully examined by ultrafast time-resolved spectroscopy.
Steady-state resonance Raman measurement was also carried out to elucidate the solvent dependence of the molecular structure of InC.
The details of the home-made cavity-dumped Kerr lens mode-locked Cr : forsterite laser and the femtosecond pump–probe measurement setup were reported elsewhere.38
The repetition rate of the cavity-dumping was 100 kHz and the output was focused into a LBO crystal to generate the second harmonic centered at 630–640 nm.
The second harmonic pulse energy was 4 nJ and the FWHM was calculated to be 27 fs.
The beam was divided into pump and probe pulses by a 50% beam splitter.
The energy of the pump pulse was 0.6–0.8 nJ and that of the probe pulse was attenuated to 60–80 pJ by a ND filter.
The pulses were focused into the sample by a 10 cm focusing lens.
The pump–probe signals were detected at a magic angle polarization with a photodiode coupled to a lock-in amplifier.
The sample path length was 0.5 mm and the absorbance of the sample was set to 1.0 at ∼610 nm, i.e., the peak of the absorption.
In this experiment, signal intensity was measured in terms of transmittance difference, ΔT.
The measured ΔT was regarded to be equivalent to absorbance difference, ΔAbs, because the signals were very weak, i.e., the ΔAbs was less than 10−4 for our experimental condition.
Transient absorption measurement with 120 fs time-resolution was carried out utilizing a dual OPA femtosecond laser system based on a Ti : sapphire laser.
The details of the system were described elsewhere.39
Briefly, the output of a femtosecond Ti : sapphire laser (Tsunami, Spectra-Physics) pumped by SHG of cw Nd3+ : YVO4 laser (Millennia V, Spectra-Physics) was regeneratively amplified with 1 KHz repetition rate (Spitfire, Spectra-Physics).
The amplified pulse (1 mJ/pulse energy and 85 fs fwhm) was divided into two pulses with same energy.
These pulses were guided into two OPA systems (OPA-800, Spectra-Physics) or into a 1 cm fused silica cell filled with H2O/D2O (3 : 7) mixture for super-continuum generation.
The wavelengths of the OPA output pulses were converted by SHG, THG, FHG, or by sum-frequency generation with the fundamental 800 nm pulse.
The output pulses were obtained with energy of 1–10 mW, fwhm of ∼120 fs, and a wavelength range that covered 300–1200 nm.
When two OPA systems were utilized, one of the energy of the output pulse was attenuated to <1/5000 and utilized as a probe pulse.
The pulse duration at the sample position was estimated to be 120 fs from the cross correlation trace at the same position.
The intensity of the probe, reference, and the pump pulses were monitored simultaneously by photodiodes and sent to a microcomputer for further analysis.
When the super continuum was utilized as the probe pulse, both the pump and the probe pulses were passed through an optical chopper rotating with a frequency of 100 Hz to reduce the optical damage of the sample.
The signal and the reference pulse were detected with two pairs of a monochrometer and a MCPD.
The obtained transient spectra were calibrated for group velocity mismatch.
Sample cell with an optical length of 2 mm was utilized and the optical density of the sample was set to ∼1.0.
Picosecond laser photolysis system with a mode-locked Nd3+:YAG laser was utilized for transient absorption measurement.40
The second harmonic at 532 nm with 15 ps fwhm and 0.5–1.0 mJ of power was utilized for excitation.
The excitation pulse was focused into a spot with a diameter of ca. 1.5 mm.
A picosecond white continuum generated by focusing the fundamental pulse into a 10 cm quartz cell containing H2O/D2O mixture (1 : 3) was employed as a probe pulse.
The white continuum was divided into two beams by a half-mirror and the reflected beam was monitored by a monochrometer and a MCPD.
The penetrated beam was utilized as a probe beam and also detected by a monochromator and a MCPD.
To cancel the effect of molecular rotational diffusion, the polarization of the white continuum was changed from linear to circular by a λ/4 plate.
Steady state absorption and emission spectra were measured by Hitachi U-3500 spectrophotometer and Hitachi 850E fluorescence spectrophotometer, respectively.
The optical density at the peak absorption wavelength of the InC solution was 0.25–0.15 for the emission measurement.
Resonance Raman scattering was measured by the 514.5 nm line of an Ar ion laser (STABLELITE 2017, Spectra-Physics) and a CCD (1152F, Princeton Instruments).
The sample concentration was ∼1.0 × 10−3 M and a rotating cell with diameter of 11.7 mm was utilized.
The laser beam was injected into the sample cell from the bottom and the perpendicular scattering was measured.
Indigo carmine (InC, >97.5%) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, >99.7%) were purchased from Kanto chemicals, N,N′-dimethylformamide (DMF, infinity pure grade), methanol (MeOH, infinity pure grade), D2O (>99.5%), and polyvinylalcohol (PVA, MW ≅ 40 000, completely hydrolyzed) were from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, N-methylformamide (MFA, >99%) and formamide (FA, >99%) were from Tokyo Chemical Industries.
H2O was filtered by ion exchange resin.
The purity of InC was checked by measuring the IR absorption spectrum of InC before and after recrystallization, which bared no difference.
The InC/PVA film was produced by mixing 2.0 mg of InC and 1.5 g of PVA in 20 ml of hot water and dropping 2 ml of the solution onto a glass plate.
The sample was dried over night under atmosphere and then kept inside a vacuum desiccator for several days.
The peak optical density of the film was about 0.7–1.0.
The steady-state absorption and fluorescence spectra of InC in various solvents are shown in Fig. 1.
The electronic spectrum of InC shows a modest solvatochromic shift with virtually similar shape.
The absorption, λabs, and fluorescence peak wavelengths, λflu, and Stokes shift, νStokes, are listed in Table 1, respectively.
The value of νStokes increased in the order of DMF < DMSO < MFA < FA ≅ MeOH < H2O which is in good agreement with the previous report.37
It was reported that plot of νStokesvs. the Mataga–Lippert polarity function, f(D,n), exhibits some degree of linearity while that of νStokesvs. ET(30) exhibits more linearity.
ET(30) is an empirical solvent polarity parameter that considers both solvent polarity and H-bonding influences on solvatochromic shifts.41,42
These solvent parameters are also listed in Table 1.
The chromophore of InC is composed from two pairs of adjacent CO and NH group separated by the central CC bond that form a H-shaped structure (Scheme 1).
The molecular orbital calculations suggest that charge-transfer takes place upon photo-excitation from the NH group to the CO group.32,43,44
However, the dipole contribution to the Stokes shift should be minor because InC possesses a quadropole moment, if the C2h symmetry of the molecule is perfect.
The finite Stokes shift suggests the breakdown of the symmetry upon photo-excitation, which may be caused by the twisting around the central CC bond or the out-of-plane deformation.
For N,N′-diacetylindigo (X = N–COCH3 in Scheme 1 (a)), X-ray crystallography shows that the molecule is not completely flat even in the ground state.43
Moreover, poor linearity of νStokesvs. f(D,n) suggests that the Stokes shift and the solvatochromism are not the results of a simple dipole solvation but also involves structural reorientation arising from the H-bonding to the solvent molecules as the ET(30) correlation suggests.
The electrostatic repulsion between the CO groups is also utilized to explain the blue shift of the absorption spectrum upon trans → cis isomerization, i.e., instability of the cis-configuration compared to the trans-configuration is much larger in the S1 state than in the S0 state which leads to a larger vertical S1 ← S0 transition energy.44
Note that indigo derivatives that exhibit efficient trans → cis isomerization have atomic groups (see Scheme 1: X = S, O, Se, N–COCH3,) that posses weaker electron donating ability than that of indigo (X = NH).
N,N′-dimethylindigo (X = N–CH3) also exhibits trans → cis isomerization although its quantum yield is low, 0.08, and the lifetime of the cis-form is rather short, a few seconds.22
Moreover, isomerization of thioindigo is known to take place through T1 state,15–21 and avoids the electrostatic repulsion in the S1 state.
In the case of oxoindigo with less charge-transfer character, the quantum yield of the trans → cis isomerization is reported to be 0.63 and trans-oxoindigo is non-fluorescent, indicating a direct isomerization from the S1 state.8
Usually cis-form is more polar than the trans-form because of the lower symmetry.
This property is utilized to crystallize cis-form of N,N′-diacethylindigo by inducing trans → cis photoisomerization in non-polar solvent.45
For indigo, polar solvation may not be enough to reduce the electrostatic repulsion of the carbonyl groups to stabilize the cis-form.
On the contrary to the ground state absorption spectra, the band shapes of the transient absorption shown in Figs. 2–4 depended drastically on solvents.
Immediately after the photo-excitation, transient absorption with maximum at ∼465 nm and 635–645 nm appeared in DMF and MeOH solution, which were assigned to the Sn ← S1 absorption.
The absorption peak at ∼645 nm in DMF was slightly blue shifted to ∼635 nm in MeOH.
These transient absorptions are similar to the Sn ← S1 absorption of thioindigo which peaks at ∼470 nm and ∼600 nm.21,46,47
Because no bleaching can be seen around 640 nm where the S1 ← S0 and Sn ← S0 absorption overlap in DMF, extinction coefficient of the Sn ← S1 transition was concluded to be larger than that of the S1 ← S0 transition.
The shoulder appearing around 605 nm in the DMF spectrum can be caused by the bleaching of the S1 ← S0 absorption with its maximum at 618 nm.
The negative signal appearing in the region of >700 nm is assigned to the stimulated emission.
In aqueous solution, the lifetime of the transient absorption was extremely short and the measurement was carried out utilizing the femtosecond Ti : sapphire DOPA system.
In Fig. 4, the transient absorption revealed that the absorption at ∼640 nm is weak compared to those in organic solvents.
Negative signal can be seen at 610–640 nm which is safely ascribed to the bleaching of the S1 ← S0 absorption.
These results indicate that the Sn ← S1 absorption in H2O is broader and blue shifted compared to those in the organic solvents.
Note that the transient absorption around 500–550 nm is relatively stronger than that in the organic solvents.
Fig. 5 shows the kinetics of the ultrafast part (<1.5 ps) of the transient absorption signal pumped and probed at 635 nm with time-resolution of 30 fs.
In addition to the solution phase, the temporal profile in PVA polymer film was also measured.
In the early stage after the excitation, the signals are strongly modulated by the coherent intramolecular vibrations caused by the resonant impulsive stimulated Raman scattering process.
The vibrational dephasing times were 0.5–0.8 ps, which did not strongly depend on solvent, and the vibrational frequencies and their assignments will be discussed later.
Note that the phase of the oscillation is similar in all solvents, including H2O where the signal possesses negative intensity.
The negative signal observed in H2O corresponds to the bleaching of the ground state absorption as can be seen in Fig. 4.
Fig. 6 shows the picosecond decay of the transient absorption pumped and probed at 635 nm in various solvents except H2O. The time constants listed in Table 2 were obtained by multi-exponential fitting of the decays shown in Figs. 5 and 6.
The intense coherent oscillation and overlap of the ground state bleach and transient absorption prevent the rational analysis of the dynamics around the time origin.
The fitting range was set to ≥53 fs, therefore, any ultrafast dynamics that occurred within the pulse duration were neglected.
In the organic solvents, three components including two with negative amplitudes were necessary to fit the signals satisfactorily.
It can be seen in Fig. 5 that the excited state absorption rapidly increased in the organic solvents.
The time constants for the rise, τ1 and τ2, were not very sensitive to the solvent property, although in PVA, the rise was significantly slow compared to other fluid solvents and can be observed in Fig. 6.
Because the probe wavelength of 635 nm is near the peak of the Sn ← S1 absorption spectrum, the rise component corresponds to the narrowing of the transient absorption caused by a conformational relaxation in the excited state.
It can be noticed in Fig. 6 that the decay profile in DMSO is identical to that in DMF and those in MeOH and FA are parallel.
The longest time constant, τ3, in organic solvents and PVA was assigned to the lifetime of the S1 state.
The fluorescence lifetime of InC in DMF was reported to be 110 ps48 which is in good agreement with our present value of 92 ± 0.4 ps.
The ultrafast time profile in aqueous solution was rather complicated and needed four components to fit the data satisfactorily.
To elucidate the accurate S1 lifetime in aqueous solution, the decay of the transient absorption and the recovery of the ground state bleach was probed at 470 nm and 610 nm, respectively, with excitation at 585 nm (Fig. 7).
The time constants of the decay and the rise measured at 470 nm and 610 nm were 3.9 ps and 4.0 ps, respectively; thus, the average of these two were regarded as the S1 lifetime of InC in aqueous solution.
The dynamics taking place faster than 4.0 ps in aqueous solution is also related to the relaxation in the excited state.
Interestingly, from Tables 1 and 2, it can be seen that the lifetime of InC decreases in solvents with larger Stokes shift.
These observations indicate that ultrafast structural reorganization and solvent reorientation have a strong influence on the deactivation process.
Thus, we have carried out experiments on deuterium isotope effect and viscosity effect.
Provided that the H-bonding is involved in the deactivation process, deuteration could cause a dynamical influence.
The time dependence of the ground state bleach signal pumped and probed at 635 nm in H2O was compared with that in D2O in Fig. 8.
The PP signals showed ultrafast decay into the negative amplitude regime and it reached the minimum value at ∼250 fs.
After the decay, the signals recovered multi-exponentially, and the PP signal overshot to positive value at ∼4 ps.
To fit the time-dependence of the signal, four components, including two with negative amplitude, were necessary (Table 2).
The signal exhibited an ultrafast decay of ∼200 fs which was not observed in other organic solvents.
The solvation dynamics of aqueous solution is known to be extremely fast, i.e., inertial response with time constant of ∼30 fs.49
It is clear from Fig. 8 that the negative bleach signal in H2O recovers to zero faster than that in D2O. This can be the evidence of the H-bond influencing the ultrafast structural reorganization and the deactivation process.
The amino-hydrogen of InC can be easily exchanged to deuterium by simply dissolving in D2O. Therefore, this could be either the effect of intra- or intermolecular H-bond.
It should be noted that the viscosities of H2O and D2O are slightly different, 1.00 cP and 1.25 cP at 20 °C and this difference also affects the deactivation process in some cases.50
The frequencies and dephasing times of the coherent oscillation observed in the signal were similar in both solvents.
The longest lifetime in highly viscous PVA (260 ± 10 ps) and slower dynamics in D2O compared to that in H2O indicate that the S1 lifetime may depend on the fluidity of the solvent.
To examine this presumption, the S1 state lifetime was plotted against viscosity in Fig. 9(a), which exhibited no correlation.
The lifetime in FA with viscosity of 3.3 cP (22 ± 0.2 ps) was the same as that in MeOH with viscosity of only 0.54 cP.
On the other hand, the lifetime in DMF with viscosity of 0.8 cP was as long as 92 ± 0.4 ps.
The lifetime is shorter in protic solvents than those in aprotic solvents.
Thus, the lifetime was plotted against ET(30) in Fig. 9(b) which showed a good correlation.
See Table 1 for the values of the solvent parameters.
ET(30) is an empirical measure of solvent polarity which also depends on H-bonding ability of the solvent.41,42
It was reported that the value of the Stokes shift also had a good linear relation with ET(30).37
When lifetime is compared with the Mataga–Lippert polarity function, f(D,n), the correlation was not as good as ET(30).
The f(D,n) of MeOH (0.324) is close to that of H2O (0.326), although the lifetimes were rather different, ∼22 ps and ∼4 ps, respectively.
The lifetime in MeOH was the same as that in FA (∼22 ps) with rather different value of f(D,n) which is 0.287.
Correlation can be also found for the solvent H-bond donor acidity parameter, α, which describes the ability of the solvent to donate a proton in a solvent-to-solute H-bond.51
The value of α is as large as 1.17 in water, whereas, those of DMF and DMSO are 0.00.
On the contrary, there was an opposite correlation with the average solvation time, 〈τ〉, obtained from the dynamic Stokes shift measurement of coumarin .15352
The values of 〈τ〉 for MeOH and FA were both 5.0 ps, while those in DMSO and DMF were shorter, i.e. 2.0 ps.
These results demonstrate that H-bond ability of the solvent plays a crucial role rather than the polarity.
Because the ultrafast part of the transient absorption signal of InC was modulated strongly by intramolecular vibrations, the Fourier transform was performed on the signals shown in Fig. 5 and the real parts of the Fourier transformed spectra are shown in Fig. 10.
The strongest mode was observed at ∼260 cm−1 in protic solvents and interestingly this mode became a doublet, ∼254 cm−1 and ∼265 cm−1, in aprotic solvents.
In our femtosecond measurement, coherent oscillation can either result from the electronic ground or excited state, because both absorptions are overlapped at the prove wavelength.
To confirm their origin, resonance Raman scattering measurement was carried out in various solvents with an excitation wavelength of 514.5 nm and the results are shown in Figs. 11 and 12.
In the low-frequency region (Fig. 11), a mode appeared at ∼260 cm−1 in protic solvents which became a doublet, 255 cm−1 and 270 cm−1, in aprotic solvents, in good agreement with the Fourier transformed spectra.
In the near-IR Fourier transform Raman spectrum of solid state indigo, three modes are observed in this frequency range, 275 cm−1 (δOC–CC), 266 cm−1 (δN–CC), and 252 cm−1 (γCC), which are assigned to in-plane and out-of-plane bending modes.53
If the intramolecular H-bonds are replaced by the intermolecular ones, slight twisting or out-of-plane deformation of the molecule can occur.
Therefore, the molecular structure will be thermally distributed along the twisting/deformation coordinate and result as a broadening of the Raman bands.
Other mode that showed strong solvent dependence was the one at 613–617 cm−1.
This mode was sharp and comparatively strong in aprotic solvents whereas it was broad and weak in protic solvents.
For indigo, out-of-plane N–H motion was located at 635 cm−1 (Raman) and 633 cm−1 (IR).53
If the mode at 613–617 cm−1 of InC can be assigned to the same mode, this also suggests that molecular planarity has declined in protic solvents.
However, in high-frequency region, 1200–1800 cm−1 (Fig. 12), we were not able to observe any notable solvent dependence.
The most important modes for indigo in this region are the CC and CO stretching modes, i.e., 1582 cm−1 and 1701 cm−1, respectively.53
For InC, strong mode can be observed at ∼1582 cm−1 and ∼1705 cm−1.
The frequency of these modes may be slightly higher in protic solvents although it is hardly noticeable.
It seems that exchange of intra- to intermolecular H-bond does not significantly change the conjugated double bonding structure of InC. Usually it is known that intramolecular H-bond that forms a five- or six-membered ring is rather strong, because of the good overlap of the molecular orbitals, and the frequency of the hydrogen accepting CO stretching mode is reduced by 10–100 cm−1.29
However, symmetric ν6 CO stretching mode of indigo observed in Raman spectrum is not significantly lower than other non-H-bonding indigo derivatives.
In solid state near-IR Fourier transformed Raman spectra, the frequency was 1701, 1674, and 1660 cm−1 for indigo, thioindigo, and selenoindigo, respectively (the frequency of indigo was the highest).
In solution, the frequency was reported to be 1705, 1688, and 1714 cm−1 for indigo, N,N′-dimethylindigo and N,N′-diacetylindigo, respectively.54
For the IR active out-of-phase ν61 CO stretching mode, the frequency of indigo was notably lower than that of other non-H-bonding indigo derivatives, i.e., 1627, 1638, 1690, 1642, 1656, 1692, and 1724 cm−1 for indigo, N,N′-dimethylindigo, N,N′-diacetylindigo, selenoindigo, thioindigo, oxoindigo, and dehydroindigo, respectively.11,29,54
Usually this is treated as the evidence of double intramolecular H-bonds, however, it should be noted that, in crystal, indigo is considered to form intermolecular H-bonds with each other.
The shifting and the broadening of the absorption spectrum in solid phase are regarded as the evidence of the self-association of indigo.13
The NH stretching mode appears as a rather broad band at 3268 and 3270 cm−1 in IR and in Raman spectrum, respectively, and the presence or absence of the H-bond is difficult to judge.53
To investigate the nature of the H-bonding, temperature dependent measurement of the Raman spectrum of InC in DMF was carried out (Fig. 13).
Usually the bonding energy of H-bond is in the order of 3–5 kcal mol−1 which can be partially broken by increasing temperature.
However, noticeable temperature dependence was not observed for the CC and CO stretching modes of InC in the range of 278–363 K (Fig. 13(a)).
The relative intensity of the CO stretching mode of InC at 1703 cm−1 was insensitive to temperature and no new bands appeared.
There are solvent bands at 1630 cm−1 and 1730 cm−1 which can disturb the observation of the temperature dependence.
Note that the solvent band at 1630 cm−1 is shifting to higher frequency with increasing temperature.
We also carried out similar temperature dependent experiment in aqueous solution and no intensity change or appearance of a new band was observed.
If H-bonding and non-H-bonding molecules are in chemical equilibrium, CO stretching is likely to appear as a doublet.
However, the observed CO stretching modes were all singlet indicating that chemical equilibrium is strongly one-sided in the studied temperature range.
There may be slight temperature dependence for the solvent sensitive low-frequency bands, i.e., the band at 255 cm−1 slightly down shifted to 252 cm−1 and the intensity of the band at 270 cm−1 seemed to be decreasing at high temperatures, although the changes were close to the limit of our experimental accuracy.
From the solvent dependent low-frequency Raman modes, it can be concluded that molecular planarity depends on solvent property, although from the constancy of the CC and CO stretching modes, the twisting or the out-of-plane deformation is not as significant as to disturb the conjugated CC structure of InC. The observation of only a single CO stretching mode in all the studied solvents and temperatures rises a question to the existence of intra- or intermolecular H-bonding in the ground state.
Even if there were an interaction between CO and NH groups or with the solvent, it should be a feeble one in the ground state.
Temperature dependence of the fluorescence intensity was measured and shown in Fig. 14.
The Arrhenius plot reveals the activation energy for the radiationless deactivation to be 8.8 kJ mol−1 and 3.5 kJ mol−1 in DMSO and H2O, respectively.
The deactivation is a barrier-crossing process and the activation energy in protic solvents was reduced to less than half the value of that in aprotic solvents.
These activation energies are similar to that expected for H-bond breaking.
We assume that slight twisting or out-of-plane deformation lead to the deactivation of the excited InC. In the case of aprotic solvents, intramolecular H-bonds exist in the excited state, which interrupt the twisting/deformation process, whereas such interruption is weakened in the protic solvents and the activation barrier is reduced.
From the steady state absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, poor linearity of νStokesvs. f(D,n) suggests that the Stokes shift and the solvatochromism are not the results of a simple dipole solvation but also involves structural reorientation arising from the H-bonding to the solvent molecules as the ET(30) correlation suggests.
From the steady state resonance Raman spectrum, it was observed that the low-frequency bands which can be assigned to the in-plane and out-of-plane bending modes, ∼255 cm−1 and ∼270 cm−1, respectively, became broad and indistinguishable at ∼260 cm−1 in protic solvents.
This indicates the reduction of molecular planarity in protic solvents.
However, the CO stretching at ∼1705 cm−1 did not show any solvent or temperature dependence.
On the contrary to the ground state absorption spectrum, the transient Sn ← S1 absorption spectrum in the aqueous solution was quite different from those in the organic solvents.
The ultrafast dynamics in D2O was noticeably slower than that in H2O which suggests the involvement of H-bonding in the deactivation process.
Elsaesser et al. concluded from their time-resolved IR absorption experiment that the NH stretching in the S1 state was shifted to lower frequency by 40 cm−1 compared to the ground state.23
This also supports the formation of the H-bonds in the excited state.
The deactivation process was strongly solvent dependent, and it was faster in protic solvents, especially in H2O, and the lifetime had a linear correlation with the empirical solvent polarity parameter, ET(30).
The deactivation was a barrier crossing process and the activation energy was lower in protic solvents.
From these observations, we propose the following deactivation scheme.
The H-bond interaction is weak in the ground state whereas it is strong in the excited state.
The central CC bond will weaken upon photo-excitation by the increased anti-bonding nature of the molecular orbital in the excited state which leads to the loss of molecular planarity.
Loss of the planarity opens a channel to the ultrafast radiationless deactivation.
However, in aprotic solvents, intramolecular H-bonds retain the molecular planarity and disturb the deactivation process.
In protic solvents, intermolecular H-bonds take place of the intramolecular ones and the activation barrier for the radiationless deactivation is reduced.
The rise components observed in ultrafast kinetics of the transient absorption (Fig. 5) could be the formation of the intra-/intermolecular H-bonds and the related conformational reorganization.
Dissipation of vibrational energy through the solute-solvent H-bond may also play a role in the deactivation process.
It is reported for betaine 30, the probe molecule utilized to determine the ET(30) values of solvents, that the vibrational energy is transferred to solvent through the H-bond.55
The cis-form of indigo is energetically unstable than the trans-form and energy barrier does not exist between these two isomers.
It is known that thermal trans → cis isomerization of N,N′-dimethylindigo can be catalyzed by acid22 indicating a low energy barrier in protic solvents.
Therefore, the deactivation process only leads back to the trans-form.
Urethane cross-linked poly(oxyethylene)/siliceous nanohybrids doped with Eu3+ ionsPart 2. Ionic association
Fourier transform mid-IR and Raman spectroscopies were employed to investigate the anionic local surrounding in sol–gel derived organic/inorganic materials–monourethanesils–incorporating europium triflate, Eu(CF3SO3)3.
The hybrid framework of these xerogels contains short methyl end capped polyether segments grafted to a siliceous network through urethane cross-links.
Samples with compositions ∞ > n ≥ 10 (where n indicates the ratio of (OCH2CH2) moieties per lanthanide ion) were examined.
The spectral data obtained provide conclusive evidence of the presence of “free” and weakly coordinated CF3SO3– ions located in two distinct sites in the whole range of salt concentration analyzed.
At n = 30 and 10, along with these species, two new anionic configurations, assigned to contact ion pairs and “cross-link separated” ions pairs, emerge.
Two-dimensional correlation spectroscopic analysis allowed to clarify the number of components present in two critical bands containing strongly overlapped spectral profiles.
The number of anionic environments found in the m-Ut(750)nEu(CF3SO3)3 family confirms the rich coordinating possibilities offered by polymer systems incorporating trivalent triflate salts.
This paper is the second of two papers devoted to the investigation of a family of Eu3+-based sol–gel derived organic/inorganic materials designated as monourethanesils.1–3
These xerogels were recently introduced with the goal of serving as model compounds of a series of structurally complex poly(oxyethylene), POE/siloxane hybrids (diureasils)4 that are excellent candidates for the construction of new low cost, multipurpose, one material-based devices, combining several technologically useful features, such as, for instance, conducting, optical and magnetic properties.4–7
With the scope of gaining a deeper knowledge of the structure/properties relationship in the diureasil system, we will continue to examine in the present work the same set of europium triflate, Eu(CF3SO3)3-doped monourethanesil samples analyzed in Part .13
The compounds studied include short methyl end capped POE chains covalently bonded to a siliceous backbone through urethane groups.
The host matrix was termed m-Ut(750), where m stands for mono, Ut indicates the urethane linkage and 750 denotes the average molecular weight of the organic precursor used (corresponding to about 17 (OCH2CH2) repeat units).
In Part 1, Fourier transform mid-IR (FT-IR) and Raman (FT-Raman) spectroscopies, photoluminescence spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry enabled us to conclude that, in terms of cation/polymer and cation/cross-link interactions, the m-Ut(750)-based xerogels may be viewed as an adequate replica of the long-chain U(2000)nEu(CF3SO3)3 diureasil parent analogs (where U indicates the urea group, 2000 denotes the average molecular weight of the organic precursor used and n is the ratio of (OCH2CH2) units per Eu3+ ion).3
As the role of the anion on the coordination of the Eu3+ ions in the monourethanesil-type system has not been considered yet, we will be specifically concerned in Part 2 with the evaluation of the extent of ionic association in the m-Ut(750)nEu(CF3SO3)3 nanocomposites in order to shed more light into the description of the local chemical environment of the lanthanide ions which was initiated in Part .13
The Eu3+⋯CF3SO3– interactions in the m-Ut(750)nEu(CF3SO3)3 hybrids will be assessed through a FT-IR/FT-Raman spectroscopic analysis of the characteristic modes of the CF3SO3– ion.
This anion is an excellent probe for investigating the cationic and anionic environments in salt/polymer systems, since the assignment of its internal vibration modes is well established.8,9
The differentiation between the various associated species (contact ion pairs, solvent separated ion pairs, ionic multiplets or salt aggregates) is manifested in the spectra through different frequency shifts and/or splittings of different magnitude of characteristic vibrational bands of the “free” anion.8–21
The present spectroscopic analysis will essentially rely on deconvolution procedures.
Unfortunately, the curve-fitting of some of the triflate bands which are most sensitive to coordination effects is not straightforward, as they are in general broad and commonly contain multiply overlapped components.
To unravel the most critical triflate regions of the spectra of the monourethanesils, we will also employ two-dimensional (2D) correlation spectroscopic analysis22.
It is generally assumed that a “free” CF3SO3– ion in a staggered configuration with a C3v point group symmetry possesses 18 normal modes with the symmetry representations 5A1 + A2 + 6E.
The A1 and E modes are IR and Raman active, whereas the A2 mode, associated with the internal torsion of the anion, is inactive both in IR and Raman.
All these modes are to a greater or lesser extent sensitive to coordination effects and can thus be employed to probe the local chemical surrounding experienced by the anion.8–21
The characteristic bands of the CF3SO3– ion are clearly discerned in the room-temperature FT-IR spectra of the m-Ut(750)nEu(CF3SO3)3 monourethanesils between 1400 and 550 cm–1 (Fig. 1) and in the room-temperature FT-Raman spectra of the same compounds in the 1600–100 cm–1 spectral range (Fig. 2).
Their frequency and assignment are given in Table 1.
The specific spectral behavior of the xerogels investigated in the present work as a function of salt content will be discussed in detail below.
The FT-IR spectra of the m-Ut(750)-based compounds with 400 ≥ n ≥ 30 exhibit a broad envelope in the νa(SO3) region (Fig. 1).
On the contrary, the FT-IR spectrum of the m-Ut(750)10Eu(CF3SO3)3 hybrid displays a series of sharp, distinct bands centered at about 1317, 1293, 1284, 1252, 1239 and 1216 cm–1 (Fig. 1).
Close analysis of the FT-IR spectrum of the non-doped hybrid host represented in Fig. 1 reveals that between 1350 and 1200 cm–1 the contribution of the polymer vibration modes is quite strong, a fact that complicates the detection of the triflate bands in the spectra of the materials incorporating Eu3+ ions.
In order to discriminate the spectral changes introduced by the addition of Eu(CF3SO3)3 to m-Ut(750), we will examine the FT-IR difference spectra reproduced in Fig. 3.
These curves were obtained by subtracting the spectrum of the non-doped matrix from those of the salt containing xerogel materials with n > 10.
This approach was not applied, however, to the m-Ut(750)10Eu(CF3SO3)3 sample because in this compound, unlike in the more dilute monourethanesils, the polyether segments play an active role in the coordination of the lanthanide ions, that results in dramatic morphological modifications in the polymer chains (Fig. 1 and Part .13)
Fig. 3 allows to infer that in the νa(SO3) region the most pronounced effect originating from the addition of increasing amounts of the guest lanthanide salt is the growth of a wide structured feature centered around 1274 cm–1.
The inset in Fig. 3 shows that this band can be resolved into three components centered at about 1287, 1274 and 1262 cm–1 (Table 1).
The typical results of the curve-fitting carried out in this envelope for the xerogel with n = 70 are reproduced in Fig. 4.
Fig. 3 also demonstrates that the band shape of the νa(SO3) event remains practically unchanged for a wide range of salt concentration (400 ≥ n ≥ 50), meaning that the increase of the guest salt content within this composition range does not change the general picture of the cation–anion interactions in the system.
Fig. 1 substantiates that, in the νa(SO3) region, the band contour of the rich-salt m-Ut(750)-based composite with n = 10 is drastically different from those of the monourethanesils with 400 ≥ n ≥ 50.
The tremendous spectral modifications discerned in this spectrum start to develop already in that of m-Ut(750)30Eu(CF3SO3)3 (Figs. 1 and 3).
To gain additional information of the changes undergone by the νa(SO3) mode of the monourethanesil xerogels at high Eu(CF3SO3)3 content (n = 30 and 10), we performed curve-fitting in the 1345–1200 cm–1 frequency envelope.
The obtained results lead us to conclude that, apart from the peaks positioned at about 1286, 1274 and 1263 cm–1 (already produced by the more dilute samples), four new components exist in the spectra of these two samples near 1317, 1295, 1251 and 1213 cm–1 (Fig. 4, Table 1).
These four bands dominate in the νa(SO3) envelope of m-Ut(750)10Eu(CF3SO3)3 (Fig. 4, Table 1).
In the FT-IR spectra of the monourethanesils with n > 30 the νs(CF3) band is found at about 1224 cm–1 (Figs. 1 and 3, Table 1).
This feature shows intensity growth with salt addition and becomes a prominent band centered at approximately 1237 cm–1 in the FT-IR spectra of the two most concentrated samples (Figs. 3 and 4, Table 1).
In the case of m-Ut(750)10Eu(CF3SO3)3, the 1237 cm–1 band is the second strongest absorption feature of the spectrum (Fig. 1).
The νa(CF3) band is seen in the FT-IR spectra of the m-Ut(750)-based materials with n > 10 as a shoulder situated around 1156 cm–1 (Table 1).
As already noted in Part 1,3 the identification of this feature is subject to some uncertainty, because it overlaps the polymer band originated from the coupled vibration of the ν(CO) and ρr(CH2) modes, situated near 1142 cm–1.
Nevertheless, the IR-difference spectra (Fig. 3) demonstrate that a sharp asymmetric band centered at about 1165 cm–1 develops in the spectrum as salt concentration rises.
This event becomes a very intense band in the spectrum of the most concentrated sample analyzed (Figs. 1 and 4).
It is noteworthy that the broad νa(CF3) profile of the latter monourethanesil becomes multicomponent (Fig. 1).
It was resolved into five components: a very intense peak situated at about 1170 cm–1, a strong component that appears as a shoulder near 1178 cm–1, and three other less intense shoulders at 1186, 1164 and 1156 cm–1 (Table 1).
Figs. 1 and 5 (left) evidence that in the νs(SO3) region the FT-IR spectra of m-Ut(750)-based compounds with 400 ≥ n ≥ 30 exhibit a narrow feature located at 1032 cm–1.
Its intensity progressively rises with the incorporation of more Eu(CF3SO3)3, but its position is salt concentration independent.
Figs. 2 and 5 (right) show that, in this range of wavenumbers, the Raman spectra of the xerogel materials with n > 10 also display a very sharp peak centered at 1032 cm–1, whose intensity grows with salt addition.
The νs(SO3) envelope was analyzed in more detail by means of 2D correlation spectroscopy.
The results of this study will be presented in the next section.
As expected, the spectral signature of the most concentrated material differs deeply from those of the more dilute monourethanesils.
Thus in the FT-IR spectrum of this sample two main events at 1037 and 1032 cm–1 and two shoulders situated at 1042 and 1022 cm–1 are evident (Fig. 5 (left), Table 1).
The corresponding Raman spectrum exhibits a strong band at 1039 cm–1 and shoulders at 1045, 1032 and 1025 cm–1 (Figs. 5 (right) and 6, Table 1).
In the FT-IR spectra of the doped monourethanesils the δs(CF3) mode appears as a very weak to weak, ill-defined event (Fig. 1).
Fig. 7 (left) shows that the intensity maximum of this band is progressively shifted toward higher wavenumbers as more salt is incorporated into the m-Ut(750) matrix (about 754, 756 and 765 cm–1 in the FT-IR spectra of the compounds with n = 400, 30 and 10, respectively).
The FT-Raman spectra illustrated in Fig. 2 allow us to conclude that in the δs(CF3) region the Eu3+-doped monourethanesils with 400 ≥ n ≥ 30 produce a sharp, weak to medium intensity feature, whose intensity maximum is displaced from approximately 755 cm–1 in the most dilute material to 757 cm–1 in the sample with n = 30.
In the spectrum of the most concentrated sample this band becomes significantly broader and weaker and its intensity maximum appears at 761 cm–1 (Fig. 2).
In addition, a shoulder located around 769 cm–1 emerges (Fig. 7 (right)).
A closer consideration of this spectral range clearly suggests, however, that several components can be resolved in this region.
A deeper investigation of the δs(CF3) feature will be performed in the following section.
Between 700 and 500 cm–1 the spectrum of the “free” triflate ion displays a band of the symmetric deformation vibration of the SO3 group, δs(SO3), around 637 cm–1 and a peak, originated from the asymmetric deformation vibration of the CF3 group, δa(CF3), positioned at about 572 cm–1.9
On coordination of the anion to metal cations, both features shift to higher wavenumbers.9,14b,19b
In the 500–300 cm–1 envelope, a non-bonded CF3SO3– ion produces two spectral bands around 346 and 308 cm–1 ascribed to the rocking vibration of the SO3 group, ρr(SO3), and to the symmetric stretching vibration of the CS group, νs(CS), respectively.9
These two modes are also upshifted upon coordination.9,14b,19b
In the FT-IR spectra of the monourethanesil compounds under investigation the δs(SO3) band is a sharp feature found at 639 cm–1, whose intensity progressively increases with the addition of lanthanide salt (Fig. 1, Table 1).
In the FT-IR spectrum of m-Ut(750)10Eu(CF3SO3)3 sample this mode becomes a very strong event (Fig. 1, Table 1).
A shoulder located near 644 cm–1 is also detected in the FT-IR spectra of the monourethane xerogels in the whole range of salt concentration (Table 1).
A comprehensive curve-fitting allowed us to conclude that the m-Ut(750)nEu(CF3SO3)3 hybrids with 400 ≥ n ≥ 30 produce in the FT-Raman spectra a very weak to weak band at about 573 cm–1 with a shoulder situated around 582 cm–1 (Table 1).
The characteristic ρr(SO3) and νs(CS) bands are discerned in the same spectra near 347 and 314 cm–1, respectively (Fig. 2, Table 1).
Their intensity is enhanced with the incorporation of increasing amounts of the guest salt.
In addition, two shoulders are found at 353 and 321 cm–1 (Table 1).
At n = 30, two other shoulders located at approximately 631 and 570 cm–1 appear in the FT-IR and FT-Raman spectra, respectively (Table 1).
Upon further addition of the guest salt (m-Ut(750)10Eu(CF3SO3)3) the former shoulder shifts to 627 cm–1 and the latter one vanishes.
In addition two new shoulders situated at 363 and 309 cm–1 emerge in the FT-Raman spectrum (Table 1).
In order to investigate in depth the changes of the spectral intensities occurring in δs(CF3) and νs(SO3) frequency envelopes as a function of salt concentration, we performed a 2D Correlation FT-IR and Raman spectroscopic study on the set of materials with 400 ≥ n ≥ 30.
The sample with n = 10 was excluded from this analysis because its vibrational spectrum exhibits crucial transformations originating from drastic reconfiguration of the polymer matrix.3
The main goal of 2D correlation vibrational spectroscopy is to detect dynamic variations of spectroscopic signals induced by an external perturbation, which in the present case was the incorporation of different amounts of Eu(CF3SO3)3.
In dynamic vibrational spectra, typical changes are variations of band intensity, frequency shifts of the bands and modifications in the shape of the peaks.
The detected spectral change is then transformed in 2D spectra by means of a specialized correlation method, such as the one described in the Experimental section.
As a result of this transformation, one obtains two 2D correlation spectra generally called synchronous and asynchronous maps.
Correlation peaks appearing in the synchronous and asynchronous maps represent in-phase and out-of-phase variation tendencies of corresponding band intensities, respectively.
It should be also stressed that 2D correlation analysis is a powerful tool for the determination of the number of spectral components in strongly overlapped profiles.22
To elucidate the question about the local coordination of the CF3SO3– ions, it was important to examine the spectral region characteristic of the δs(CF3) mode, which has been found to be extremely sensitive to the environmental changes around the anion.10a–d,10f–r
The synchronous 2D correlation Raman spectra obtained for the series of monourethane cross-linked xerogels with 200 ≥ n ≥ 30 in the 770–750 cm–1 frequency region (Fig. 8 (top)) displays a single peak located on the diagonal of 2D correlation map with the coordinate of 761 cm–1.
We must note that the peaks at diagonal positions, designated as autopeaks, develop in the spectral intervals which demonstrate stronger intensity change with the external perturbation.22
Consequently, the 2D correlation analysis indicates that, as salt content rises, the strongest intensity change appears around 761 cm–1, i.e., at a characteristic frequency of coordinated triflate species.
This means that, as more Eu(CF3SO3)3 is introduced into the m-Ut(750) matrix, the concentration of the triflate environment responsible for the 761 cm–1 component increases in the xerogels.
The growth of this event is clearly evidenced in the Raman spectra of the m-Ut(750)nEu(CF3SO3)3 compounds with 200 ≥ n ≥ 30 (Fig. 7 (right)).
The asynchronous 2D correlation map derived for the same set of monourethanesil samples in the same range of frequencies is given in Fig. 8 (bottom).
It is believed that cross peaks (i.e., off-diagonal peaks) in asynchronous 2D spectra usually indicate the lack of strong chemical interactions or direct connectivity between the functional groups.
They appear rather due to a difference in reorientational rates of transition moments of the functional groups which are located in different local molecular environments.22
By extending lines from the spectral coordinates of the cross peaks to the corresponding diagonal positions, one obtains the frequencies at which the maximum variation of spectral intensities is observed.22
Thus the map shown in Fig. 8 (bottom) suggests that there are three distinct components located at 761, 757 and 753 cm–1 in the δs(CF3) band envelope.
Based on these results we carried out curve-fitting of the δs(CF3) envelope.
The δs(CF3) region of the monourethanesils with 400 ≥ n ≥ 30 was decomposed into three components centered at about 762, 757 and 753 cm–1 (Fig. 9, Table 1).
The band at lowest frequency is associated with “free” anions,9 whereas the other two are due to coordinated CF3SO3– ions.
In the spectrum of the sample with n = 10 two additional peaks are seen at 769 and 765 cm–1 (Fig. 9, Table 1).
The latter event is assigned to coordinated anions.
The 769 cm–1 feature must be characteristic of the crystalline compound.3
Fig. 10 shows the contour of the asynchronous 2D correlation map constructed from the salt concentration perturbed FT-IR spectra of the monourethanesils with 200 ≥ n ≥ 30 in the 1045–1020 cm–1 region.
This map exhibits four cross peaks, two of positive and two of negative intensity.
Hence, in the investigated νs(SO3) envelope three spectral components centered at 1036, 1032 and 1026 cm–1 may be resolved (Fig. 10).
Similar conclusions were obtained through curve-fitting (Fig. 6, Table 1).
The most intense peak, located at 1032 cm–1, is attributed to the ‘free’ triflate anions.9
The pair of events at 1036 and 1026 cm–1 may be associated with coordinated anions in two different ionic environments.19b,20a
It must be noted at this stage that the band observed in the 1045–1020 cm–1 spectral interval may be fitted with a good accuracy by a single Lorentzian peak (especially at low salt contents).
In two Raman studies of ion association in complexes formed between POE or poly(oxypropylene) and triflate salts containing mono-, di- and trivalent cations, it was shown that the 1032 cm–1 band, characteristic of the “free” triflate ion, always demonstrated Lorentzian shape regardless the type of cation.18a,b
However, it is essential to remark that, while in the Raman spectra reported in refs. 18a and b the half-width of the 1032 cm–1 feature was about 5.5 cm–1 (with the highest value of 7 cm–1 detected in a material doped with Nd3+ ions), in the spectra of the xerogels investigated in the present work the fit by a single Lorentzian curve produces a peak with half-width of 9.5 cm–1 for the low concentration samples, which further increases up to 11.5 cm–1 as the guest salt content rises.
Under such conditions it is clear that fitting by a single Lorentzian shape may hide the presence of side bands of lower intensity.
Therefore, in the selection of the fitting parameters we took into account the three following factors: (i) the unexplainably large half-width found when the band was fitted by a single Lorentzian profile; (ii) the high probability of existence of differently coordinated triflate species; (iii) the results derived from the 2D correlation analysis performed in this frequency envelope (Fig. 10).
Since we do not use the curve-fitting data for the determination of the total integral intensities, but just to estimate frequency positions of the components, we believe that the present analysis is reliable.
In this section we will attempt to deduce, on the basis of specific spectral triflate features, the bonding configurations of the anions in the m-Ut(750)10Eu(CF3SO3)3 family of xerogels to gain more insight into the general picture of ionic association in these hybrids.
In the 400 ≥ n ≥ 50 composition range, the characteristic νa(SO3) envelope contains three bands located at about 1286, 1275 and 1263 cm–1 (Figs. 3 and 4).
The 1275 cm–1 band is attributed to “free” CF3SO3– ions,8,9 whereas the origin of the two other components is not straightforward.
It is known that a strong interaction between the SO3 group and the cation, such as that involved in a contact ion pair, lifts the double degeneracy of the νa(SO3) mode, thus leading to the appearance of two split bands.
According to the observations of Bernson et al.,20a,b the typical νa(SO3) splitting values for contact ion pairs in polymer electrolytes containing lanthanide triflates range from 95 to 110 cm–1, depending on the type of polymer matrix, type of cation used, and salt concentration.
In the case of solvent-separated ion pairs, in which the strength of cation–anion interaction becomes essentially lower, the magnitude of the splitting was found to be ca. 40 cm–1.20b
In the monourethanesils with 400 ≥ n ≥ 50 the splittings observed are significantly smaller (about 25 cm–1), thus suggesting that the species responsible for this effect can be neither contact ion pairs, nor solvent separated ion pairs.
The fact that the three-component profile is also detected in the spectra of the monourethanesils with extremely low salt content (n = 400 and 200), in which the formation of contact ion pairs is practically impossible, is consistent with our claim.
We propose that the remarkably small νa(SO3) splitting produced by the m-Ut(750)nEu(CF3SO3)3 samples with 400 ≥ n ≥ 50 is a direct consequence of the weakness of the interaction existent between the CF3SO3– and the Eu3+ ions.
We may further speculate that this coordinating situation could involve CF3SO3– species weakly bonded to Eu3+ ions, which simultaneously interact with the carbonyl oxygen atoms of the urethane groups (A).
In addition, the existence of CF3SO3– ions hydrogen-bonded to the N–H groups cannot be excluded (B). 
When the salt content reaches n = 30, the behavior of the monourethanesil system suffers marked modifications.
As was shown in Part 1,3 at this particular composition new effects are produced: (1) a fraction of the N–H groups start to be free from hydrogen bonding interaction with the CO groups; (2) the lanthanide ions start to coordinate to the POE chains.
Fig. 4 shows that in the νa(SO3) region of the FT-IR spectrum of m-Ut(750)30Eu(CF3SO3)3, along with the 1284/1262 cm–1 pair and the 1274 cm–1 feature, new split components, which can be recognized as the 1295/1251 and 1317/1213 cm–1 pairs, emerge (Table 1).
Bands at 1295 and 1251 cm–1 were also detected in the spectra of poly(ethylene glycol)/La(CF3SO3)3 electrolytes.20b
These events were ascribed to the split components resulting from the presence of solvent separated ion pairs.
In the monourethane cross-linked hybrids such spectral effect might appear due to the presence of “cross-link separated” ion pairs.
The POE chains probably contribute to the formation of the latter ionic aggregates.
The 1317/1213 cm–1 pair observed in the FT-IR spectrum of the xerogel with n = 30 can be associated with contact ion pairs, since similar bands were seen at approximately the same position in the spectra of POEnEu(CF3SO3)3 electrolytes with n = 16 and .920a
At the highest salt concentration examined here (n = 10), the growth of the bands corresponding to the second and third coordinating environments just described and the reduction of those due to the “free” and weakly coordinated triflate ions are evident.
In the νs(CF3) region of all the monourethanesils studied the appearance of the 1224 and 1237 cm–1 features corroborates the claim that “free”9 and coordinated triflate ions9,20a,b exist within the whole range of salt concentrations investigated (Figs. 1 and 4, Table 1).
The existence of non-coordinated anions in the materials with 400 ≥ n ≥ 30 is also supported by the location of the νa(CF3) mode which is seen at approximately 1156 cm–1.8
The bands found at 1186, 1178, 1170, 1164 and 1156 cm–1 in the νa(CF3) envelope of the FT-IR spectrum of m-Ut(750)10Eu(CF3SO3)3 (Table 1) confirm that non-bonded anions subsist at this composition and strongly suggest that the anion is involved in four different coordinating environments in this salt-rich xerogel, a result that is in perfect agreement with the conclusions retrieved from the νa(SO3) region.
The presence of “free” anions in the doped monourethanesils (a conclusion drawn from the examination of the νa(SO3), νs(CF3) and νa(CF3) regions) is further confirmed by the appearance of the 1032 cm–1 band, characteristic of the νs(SO3) vibration of the “free” triflate ion (Figs. 1, 2 and 6, Table 1).
The occurrence of two components on both sides of the 1032 cm–1 feature in the spectra of the hybrids with n > 10 (Fig. 6, Table 1) corroborates the results of the νa(SO3) region, which indicated that two anionic bonding environments exist in this salt concentration interval (Figs. 1, 3 and 4, Table 1)
It must be stressed that in the sample with n = 10 the number of νs(SO3) components that represent distinct anionic sites (i.e., three) is in apparent contradiction with the information obtained from the analysis of the νa(SO3) band envelope which indicated the existence of four different anionic configurations.
This effect can, however, be explained on the basis of the conclusions of Petersen et al18b. who showed that the νs(SO3) mode of solvent separated ions appears at 1032 cm–1, typically ascribed to “free” CF3SO3– ions.
Therefore, we are led to suggest that the 1032 cm–1 component discerned in the spectrum of the rich-salt hybrid with n = 10 most probably receives contributions from, not only the “free” anions, as usual, but also from the “cross-link separated” ion pairs.
As it is beyond the scope of the present work to characterize the ionic aggregates responsible for the multicomponent νs(SO3) band profile of the m-Ut(750)-based compounds, we will simply consider that the two shoulders observed in the νs(SO3) region of the samples with 400 ≥ n ≥ 30 are originated from weakly coordinated CF3SO3– ions (Table 1).
The 1042 cm–1 (FT-IR)/1045 cm–1 (Raman) component of m-Ut(750)10Eu(CF3SO3)3 is tentatively attributed to the formation of the crystalline compound (Fig. 6, Table 1).
Considering the complicated behavior of the νs(SO3) vibration, it was proposed that the mode of symmetric CF3 deformation, δs(CF3), is a much more reliable way of identifying differently coordinated CF3SO3– ions.10a–d,f–r
According to Frech et al.,10a–d,f–r although the CF3 end of the anion is not expected to participate directly in the coordination process, cation–anion interactions affect the whole anion.
The δs(CF3) vibration is seen at about 752 cm–1 when the ion is “free”.9
As this mode is non-degenerate, specific bonding geometries result in shifts to higher wavenumbers.
The interpretation of the δs(CF3) envelope of the Eu3+-doped monourethanesils is not straightforward.
The only reference found in the literature regarding the δs(CF3) region of lanthanide triflate electrolytes20b reports the presence of a dominating band centered at 762 cm–1 and a less intense peak at 754 cm–1 in the spectra of La(CF3SO3)3 dissolved in poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether.
The two events were assigned to ion pairs and “free” anions, respectively.20b
In the present case, the complexity of the band contour clearly suggests that the number of underlying components is much greater.
The examination of the δs(CF3) region of the most concentrated monourethanesil allowed us to conclude about the existence of four coordinating sites.
In the case of the less concentrated xerogels, the 2D correlation analysis clearly showed the presence of two coordinating environments.
This finding means that, according to our spectral data, in samples with n = 10 and n > 10 the anionic configurations deduced from the study of the δs(CF3) mode (i.e., four and two, respectively) are identical to those derived from the other triflate regions analyzed above.
In the low-frequency region of the spectra of the m-Ut(750)nEu(CF3SO3)3 composites, unmistakable evidences of the existence of unpaired and coordinated CF3SO3– ions are apparent in the whole range of salt concentration (Table 1).
The new shoulders detected in the spectra of the samples with n = 30 and 10 are tentatively associated with the crystalline complex formed at this composition (Table 1).
It is finally instructive to mention that in the course of this investigation we recorded the FT-IR spectra of the monourethanesils in the temperature range between 20 and 85 °C (data not shown).
The spectra of all the samples were found to be temperature independent, an indication that the existing cation and anion coordinating environments are quite stable.
Monourethane cross-linked poly(oxyethylene)/siloxane hybrids incorporating a wide range of europium triflate, Eu(CF3SO3)3, concentration (∞ ≥ n ≥ 10, where n is the molar ratio of (OCH2CH2) repeat units per Eu3+ ion) were investigated by means of Fourier transform mid-IR and Raman spectroscopies to study the cation–anion interactions.
This spectroscopic analysis relied essentially on the examination of the most informative bands of the triflate ion (in particular, the νa(SO3), νs(SO3) and δs(CF3) modes) at increasing salt concentration.
Two-dimensional correlation spectroscopic analysis was employed in the case of the νs(SO3) and δs(CF3) features that exhibited strong overlapped profiles.
This work showed that in the m-Ut(750)nEu(CF3SO3)3 xerogels with 400 ≥ n ≥ 50 the triflate ions exist only as “free” and weakly coordinated species (O(triflate)⋯Eu3+⋯OC(urethane) and/or O(triflate)⋯H–N(urethane)).
At n = 30, in addition to these coordinating situations, two new ionic configurations appear: contact ion pairs and “cross-link separated” ion pairs.
These two environments are a consequence of the major modification undergone by the system involving the reconfiguration of the POE chains and the destruction of the hydrogen bonds established between N–H groups and carbonyl moieties or POE chains.
In the most concentrated sample analyzed (n = 10) direct cation–anion coordination becomes dominating and the formation of a crystalline polymer/salt complex is observed.

In 2D spectroscopy, the variations in the spectra produced by an external sample perturbation are mathematically cross-correlated to construct a 2D correlation map, which allows to discriminate those vibration modes which selectively respond to the perturbation.
Two kinds of 2D spectra, defined by two independent wavenumbers (ν1, ν2), are generated by cross-correlation analysis of dynamic fluctuations of spectral signals induced by an external perturbation: the synchronous and asynchronous spectra.22
While the synchronous 2D correlation spectrum represents the simultaneous (or coincidental) changes of spectral intensities measured at ν1 and ν2 within the interval between Tmin and Tmax of the externally defined variable t, the asynchronous one represents sequential (or successive) changes of spectral intensities measured at ν1 and ν2.
In the present work 2D correlation spectroscopic analysis was carried out using the following procedure.
First, the reference spectrum was subtracted from each of the experimental spectra in order to obtain the dynamic spectra (mean-centered procedure.22)
For practical reasons, in our calculations the average spectrum was used as a reference.
The resulting mean-centered dynamic spectra y(ν,t) represent the relative variations of spectral intensity at each wavenumber ν as a function of the lanthanide salt concentration t.
We then calculated, for the set of dynamic spectra, the complex correlation function 〈y(ν1,t),y(ν2,t′)〉 = Φ(ν1,ν2) + iΨ(ν1,ν2) using the Hilbert transform algorithm developed by Noda.22
The real and imaginary parts of this function correspond to the synchronous Φ(ν1,ν2) and asynchronous Ψ(ν1,ν2) 2D correlation maps of the dynamic spectra, respectively.
The synchronous 2D correlation intensities were defined by the equation and the asynchronous 2D spectra were determined using the expression where the Hjk is a Hilbert transformation matrix.22
Here ν represents the IR or Raman wavenumber and n is the total number of dynamic spectra.
All the calculations were performed with the Matlab 6.0 software (The MathWorks Inc)..
The search for stable and efficient sonoelectrocatalysts for oxygen reduction and hydrogen peroxide formation: azobenzene and derivatives
We report the electrochemical reduction of oxygen using glassy carbon electrodes modified with azobenzene, hydroazobenzene, or fast black K salt (2,5-dimethoxy-4-[(4-nitrophenyl)azo] benzenediazonium tetrachlorozincate).
The performance of the electrodes under ultrasound was explored.
At the highest intensity (87 W cm−2) with one hour continuous insonation, voltammetric signals for azobenzene decreased by 7%, hydroazobenzene by 9% and fast black K by 18%.
The catalytic rate constants of the immobilised species towards oxygen reduction were assessed via cyclic, rotating disc and sono-voltammetry.
The rate constants were found to be 6.1 × 103 M−1 s−1 for azobenzene, 7.4 × 103 M−1 s−1 for hydroazobenzene and 10.4 × 103 M−1 s−1 for fast black K. These values suggest the use of these modified electrodes as practical hydrogen peroxide generators.
The electrochemical reduction of oxygen to form hydrogen peroxide is of wide interest.1–4
The usual approach is through the immobilisation of catalytic materials to reduce the typically large over-potentials which are required for the direct reduction of oxygen at most electrode substrates.5
Electrode modification for electro-catalysis of oxygen reduction is popular since through immobilisation onto electrode surfaces via physically or covalent attachment electrocatalytic activities can be significantly improved.6
Many different materials have been proposed as electrocatalysts.
These include carbon nanotubes,7 Co(ii)-macrocycle complexes,8 poly(naphthoquinone) films,9 manganese dioxide,10 copper-nickel alloys,11 platinum modified gold electrodes,12 cobaloxime complexes,6 transition metal phthalocyanines,13 anthraquinone polymers14 and gold nanoparticles15 and anthraquinones.5,16–20
In the last example, immobilization of anthraquinone species onto the surface of electrodes leads to hydrogen peroxide production via the following reaction:5,6,18–21Q(ads) + 2e− + 2H+(aq) → H2Q(ads)where Q(ads) is the adsorbed anthraquinone moiety.
A large number of synthetic chemists seeking greener syntheses are turning toward hydrogen peroxide based oxidations, since water is the sole by-product of these oxidations.22
Moreover expensive catalysts and solvents may be avoided while the need for costly organic peroxides or chlorine based oxidations can be eliminated.22
Noyori has pioneered ‘green’ oxidation chemistry with aqueous hydrogen peroxide as oxidant23 showing that cyclohexene can be oxidized to adipic acid,24 benzylic alcohols to benzaldehydes and benzoic acids.25
Also possible is the epoxidation of terminal olefins26 and the oxidation of alcohols.27
Recently trans-1,2-diols have been synthesized using olefins and hydrogen peroxide with high yield and selectivity.22
Hydrogen peroxide is made commercially via anthraquinone reduction known as the ‘AO-process’.28
This involves the hydrogenation, for example, of 2-alkyl-9,10-anthraquinone (with a catalyst such as nickel or palladium) forming the corresponding hydroquinone and oxidation with oxygen (usually air) to yield hydrogen peroxide and reforming the starting anthraquinone.
Commonly the anthraquinone is dissolved in a solvent or solvent mixture for hydrogenation, oxidation and extraction.
Due to the differing solubility of the quinone and hydroquinone species, solvent mixtures are commonly employed.28
The benefits of ultrasound in electrochemistry have recently been highlighted.29–31
In this context sustained high rates of mass transport are achieved from a combination of acoustic streaming and interfacial cavitational activity.
This is extremely useful in sono-electrosynthesis where the sustained transport can very significantly reduce electrolysis times whilst cavitational activity can keep the electrode ‘active’ under circumstances where passivation otherwise takes place.
Last it is worth noting that when ultrasound is applied to an aqueous media, cavitational collapse can produce low levels of in-situ formed hydrogen peroxide.30,32,33
Recently we have investigated the electro-catalytic reduction of oxygen at an Alizarin physically modified glassy carbon under ultrasound where catalytic currents were significantly enhanced under the high mass-transport conditions of ultrasound and quantitatively consistent with a modified Koutecky–Levich equation.20
Furthermore we have explored 9,10-phenanthraquinone and 1,2-naphthoquinone physically absorbed onto glassy carbon working electrodes and found them to be suitable as sonoelectrocatalysts for oxygen reduction and hydrogen peroxide formation.16
Such sono-electrodes offer scope for a green source of hydrogen peroxide in which oxygen (air) can be reduced with a high efficiency at an insonated electrode to provide a cheap and clean supply of hydrogen peroxide at the point of usage.
In this paper we report the use of azobenzene, hydroazobenzene and fast black K salt (2,5-dimethoxy-4-[(4-nitrophenyl)azo] benzenediazonium chloride) for the catalytic reduction of oxygen.
Azobenzene can be adsorbed either in its oxidised form, or in its two electron reduced form, hydroazobenzene: C6H5–N=N–C6H5 + 2e− + 2H+ ⇌ C6H5–NH–NH–C6H5All three species were physically adsorbed onto glassy carbon electrodes with the catalytic rate constants assessed using cyclic, rotating disc and sono-voltammetry.
The stability of the modified glassy carbon electrodes were investigated under ultrasound and were found to be extremely stable providing a basis for the sono-electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide.
All chemicals used in this work were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification.
These were: azobenzene (Aldrich, 96%), fast black K salt (2,5-dimethoxy-4-[(4-nitrophenyl)azo] benzenediazonium tetrachlorozincate, Sigma,+98%), hydrazobenzene (Aldrich, 99%) and acetonitrile (Fischer Chemicals, synthetic grade).
The buffers used were as follows: acetate buffers for pH 3.0 and 5.0, phosphate buffers for pH 2.0, 7.0 and 8.0 and boric buffer for pH 10.0.
All solutions were prepared with deionised water of resistivity not less than 18.2 MΩ cm (Vivendi Water Systems, UK).
Before commencing experiments, nitrogen (BOC, Guildford, Surrey, UK) was used for deaeration of solutions.
Conversely, for oxygen measurements, oxygen (BOC, Guildford, Surrey, UK) was bubbled for at least 10 min to saturate the solution.
Voltammetric measurements were carried out on a μ-Autolab (ECO-Chemie, Utrecht, The Netherlands) potentiostat.
All measurements were conducted in a thermostatted (22 °C) three-electrode cell with a solution volume of 40 cm3.
The working electrodes were either an edge plane pyrolytic graphite electrode (Le Carbone Ltd, Sussex, UK, 5 mm diameter) or a glassy-carbon electrode (GC, 3 mm diameter, BAS, Indiana, USA).
A different glassy carbon disc (3 mm diameter, mounted in teflon) was used for rotating disc experiments.
The counter electrode was a bright platinum wire, with a saturated calomel electrode (Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark) completing the circuit.
Sonoelectrochemical studies were performed using an ultrasonic horn, model CV 26 (Sonics and Materials Inc. USA), operating at a frequency of 25 kHz and fitted with a 3 mm diameter titanium alloy microtip (Jencons, Leyton Buzzard, UK).
The intensity of the ultrasound was determined calorimetrically34–36 and it was found that a 20% amplitude corresponded to 87 W cm−2.
The working electrode was placed in a face-on arrangement to the ultrasonic horn.
The horn was immersed beyond the shoulder of the stepped tip to ensure that ultrasound is efficiently applied into the solution.
The horn-to-electrode distance was fixed at 10 mm throughout all measurements.
During experiments, the temperature was kept constant at 22 °C (±2 °C) by the use of a stainless steel cooling coil.
It is important to note that for sono-Koutecky–Levich measurements, the concentration of oxygen under insonation has already been investigated where it was observed that ultrasound can be applied for up to 2 min before 10% of the oxygen is lost20.
GC electrodes were carefully pre-treated before modification since it has been reported37 that the electrode history has effects on both the modification and the electrochemical behaviour of the electrode.
Prior to each modification, GC electrodes were polished with diamond lapping compounds (Kelmet, UK) and then carefully rinsed.
The oxidative pre-treatment of GC electrodes was the same as the one reported by Salimi and co-workers:20 the polished GC electrodes were subjected to cycling between −0.5 and +2.0 V at a scan rate 100 mV s−1 in 0.1 M sulfuric acid for 10 min.
The electrode was then poised at +1.8 V in the same solution for 3 min.
The pre-treated electrode was modified with azobenzene by pippetting 20 μL of 1 mM solution of azobenzene in acetonitrile on to the electrode surface.
The solvent was allowed to evaporate off at room temperature leaving azobenzene physically adsorbed on to the GC electrode.
Note that, as discussed below, microcrystals of azobenzene are also formed by this procedure so that the electrode surface immediately after modification has both physically adsorbed azobenzene and microcrystals on it.
The latter can be removed by potential cycling (vide infra).
Glassy carbon electrodes modified with hydrazobenzene or fast black K salt were prepared by the same procedure.
Note that if the electrode is simply placed into a 1 mM solution of azobenzene, left for 5 min, removed and rinsed and then placed into a pH 2 buffer solution, no voltammetric waves are observed.
The voltammetry of azobenzene at an edge plane pyrolytic graphite electrode was first explored.
The electrode was modified as described in section 2.3 and placed into an oxygen free pH 2 phosphate buffer solution with cyclic voltammograms recorded over various scan rates.
As shown in Fig. 1, a reduction peak is visible at ca. −0.60 V (vs. SCE) and this corresponds to the reduction of azobenzene to hydroazobenzene as described by eqn. (3)38,39 with the corresponding oxidation peak observed at ca. +0.40 V. Next a new electrode was prepared and the voltammetric window extended to more negative potentials.
The first scan is shown in Fig. 2, curve A, where the reduction peak of azobenzene to hydroazobenzene is first observed with the second wave at ca. −1.2 V (vs. SCE) corresponding to the irreversible reduction of hydroazobenzene to aniline.38
[C6H5–HN–NH–C6H5 + 2e− + 2H+→ 2C6H5–NH2]On the second scan (Fig. 2, curve B) a single reduction wave is only seen corresponding to azobenzene reduction, with continual scanning resulting in a decrease of the voltammetric response, consistent with literature reports that hydroazobenzene is reduced irreversibly to aniline.38,39
A polished edge plane electrode was left in a 2 mM acetonitrile solution of azobenzene for 12 h, removed, carefully rinsed and put in fresh, oxygen-free pH 2 phosphate buffer.
It is interesting to note that cyclic voltammograms recorded after this treatment show a small reduction wave at ca. −0.6 V (vs. SCE), which is ca. seven times smaller than that seen compared to the electrode modified via evaporation.
We next turn to investigating the response of a modified glassy carbon (GC) electrode.
The electrochemical behaviour of the modified GC electrode was examined in an oxygen free pH 2 phosphate buffer solution.
The first scan is shown in Fig. 3A which shows two reduction waves at −0.11 (±0.01) V and −0.45 (±0.01) V (vs. SCE) with a single oxidation wave on the cathodic sweep.
Fig. 3B shows the second scan (curve A), fifth (curve B) and the final stabilised scan (curve C).
Comparison of the first scan (Fig. 3A) and second scan (Fig. 3B, curve A) reveals a large decrease in the peak current.
This suggests that when the electrode is modified a mixture of azobenzene microcrystals and a monolayer (or less) exists such that as the potential is scanned to negative values, the first reduction peak at −0.11 V is the reduction of azobenzene to hydroazobenzene (eqn. (3)) with both species in the form of a monolayer while the large broader peak at −0.45 V is the reduction of azobenzene in the form of crystals which dissolve from the electrode surface when reduced, such that on the second scan the large broad peak is absent suggesting that only the monolayer (or less) response is left.
We note that Komorsky-Lovrić has studied the voltammetry of azobenzene microcrystals abrasively attached to a basal plane pyrolytic graphite electrode, observing a reduction peak at ca. −0.40 V at pH .238
The effect of pH on the response of azobenzene was explored (after the signal had stabilised).
It was observed that redox peak was pH-dependent and shifted towards more negative potentials upon increasing the solution pH.
The potential of the reduction peak shifts by 57 mV (pH unit)−1 consistent with a two-proton two-electron process.
A plot of peak current vs. scan rate was found to be linear, as expected for surface confined species with the surface concentration of azobenzene physically adsorbed on glassy carbon electrode (after stabilisation) was calculated using the following relationship:Γ = Q/nFAwhere Q is charge under voltammetric peak, n is the number of electrons transferred, F is the Faraday constant and A, the electrode area.
The surface coverage was found to be 68.9 (±0.6) × 10−10 mol cm−2.
The reduction of oxygen on glassy carbon electrodes modified with monolayer physically adsorbed azobenzene was next studied.
The reduction of oxygen using an azobenzene modified glassy carbon electrode was next studied.
First, cyclic voltammograms were run in an oxygen-saturated solution.
Shown in Fig. 4 are the responses obtained for a bare glassy carbon electrode (curve C) and for a modified glassy carbon electrode modified with azobenzene in a pH 2 phosphate buffer solution saturated with oxygen (curve B).
For comparison the modified electrode in the absence of oxygen (curve A) is shown.
At a bare electrode, the oxygen reduction occurs with a peak potential at ca. −0.53 (±0.01) V (vs. SCE).
For the modified electrode a large reduction wave is observed with the corresponding oxidation peak disappearing on the reverse scan suggesting excellent catalytic behaviour.
Comparison of oxygen reduction at the modified and bare glassy carbon electrodes reveals that the oxygen wave in the latter case shifts to less negative potentials from −0.53 (±0.01) V to −0.37 (±0.01) V.
Cyclic voltammograms were next recorded in various pH buffer solutions saturated with oxygen with the ‘best’ pH for oxygen reduction investigated; this criterion is met when the oxygen reduction wave using the modified electrode is at its most positive potential.
This was found to correspond to pH 2.
Consequently all further electrochemical studies using azobenzene were carried out at pH 2.0.
The electrocatalytic rate constant for oxygen reduction on a GC electrode modified with azobenzene was determined from cyclic voltammetry data using Andrieux and Savéant theory:40Ip = yFACbulkD1/2(Fv/RT)1/2where F is the Faraday constant, A is the electrode area, Cbulk is the bulk concentration of oxygen, D is the diffusion coefficient of oxygen, ν is the scan rate.
Experimentally, the modified electrode for the voltammetric reduction of oxygen in an oxygen-saturated solution is scanned at slow scan rates.
The gradient of a plot of peak current versus square root of scan rate produces y.
This value is used via a theoretically derived curve to determine x, where x is:40where the symbols have their usual meanings.
Shown in the electronic supplementary information (ESI) is a plot of peak current versus square root of scan rate, which is linear.
The rate constant from this plot using the Andrieux and Savéant theory was found to be 6.1 (±0.1) × 103 M−1s−1 for the surface coverage of azobenzene of 69 (±0.3) × 10−10 mol cm−2 using the oxygen diffusion coefficient of 1.6 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 and a value of 1.2 mM as the concentration of an oxygen saturated aqueous solution.18
For comparison, the kinetic parameters for the oxygen reduction reaction on a GC electrode modified with azobenzene was next evaluated using the rotating disc electrode (RDE) method via the Koutecky–Levich equation:41where k is catalytic rate constant, Cbulk the bulk concentration of oxygen, ν is the hydrodynamic viscosity, ω is the rotation speed, while all other parameters have usual meaning.
First however, a glassy carbon rotating disc electrode was modified with azobenzene by the same procedure as used for the GC electrode as described in section 2.3.
Using cyclic voltammetry the coverage of azobenzene on the RDGCE was found to be 66.4 (±0.5) × 10−10 mol cm−2.
Rotating disc voltammograms at a range of rotation speeds were recorded in oxygen saturated solution.
Using a potential of −0.37 V (vs. SCE), a Koutecky–Levich plot was constructed.
The rate constant was evaluated from the intercept of Koutecky–Levich plot.
Using this plot, the catalytic rate constant was found to be 5.9 (±0.2) × 103 M−1 s−1, which is in excellent agreement with the value obtained via cyclic voltammetry data.
Next, we turn to oxygen reduction at a glassy carbon electrode modified with azobenzene using sonovoltammetry.
First we consider the behaviour and stability under ultrasound of the azobenzene modified glassy carbon electrode: it is recognised that for some adsorbates sustained insonation can lead to significant ablation42 Ultrasound was applied to the modified electrode at different intensities for various time periods at a constant horn-to-electrode distance of 10 mm.
Fig. 5 shows cyclic voltammograms recorded at different time intervals, with a plot of the peak current versus applied time of insonation.
Applying a maximum ultrasound intensity of 87 W cm−2 resulted in practically no ablation; the value of initial peak current before application of ultrasound was 21 μA, while after 10 min of insonation the peak current decreased to 20 μA, corresponding to a 5% decrease.
After applying ultrasound for 1 h, a 7% decrease in the signal was observed.
Conversely applying ultrasound intensity of 36 W cm−2, the peak current was observed to decrease by 4% after 10 min and 5% after 1 h of continuous insonation from its original value.
These results show that the azobenzene-modified electrodes are very stable under ultrasound and therefore potentially suitable for use as sonoelectrocatalysts for hydrogen peroxide generation.
Next, the catalytic rate constant was measured via sono-voltammetry.
First the surface coverage of azobenzene on the GC electrode was determined via cyclic voltammetry and found to be 57.5 (±0.4) × 10−10 mol cm−2.
The modified GC electrode was placed into a face-on arrangement in an oxygen-saturated pH 2 phosphate buffer solution at a fixed horn-to-electrode distance of 10 mm.
As shown in Fig. 6, comparison of the response of the modified electrode in the absence and presence of an acoustic field reveals a significant increase in current arising from the acoustic streaming.30
The rate constant for oxygen reduction was calculated using the following equation:20where n is the number of electrons transferred, F, is the Faraday constant, A is the electrode area, D is the diffusion coefficient, Cox is the bulk concentration of oxygen, and Γ is the surface coverage of the adsorbate.
The rate constant was found to be 7.3 (±0.2) 103 M−1 s−1 if the value of surface coverage before insonation was used (57.5 (±0.4) × 10−10 mol cm−2).
If the value of 52.6 (±0.3) × 10−10 mol cm−2 obtained for surface concentration after applying ultrasound was used, the rate constant was calculated to be 8.0 × 103 M−1 s−1.
The average value of 7.6 × 103 M−1 s−1 is in reasonable agreement with the values obtained by cyclic voltammetry and RDE analysis.
The chemical rate parameter, defined as the catalytic rate constant multiplied by the surface coverage, was calculated for all three methods and found to be 41.9 × 10−3 cm s−1 for cyclic voltammetry measurements, 39.2 × 10−3 cm s−1 for the RDE method and 41.9 × 10−3 cm s−1via sonovoltammetry.
First the voltammetry of hydroazobenzene was explored at an edge plane pyrolytic graphite modified electrode.
The cyclic voltammogram was started at −0.3 V (vs. SCE), scanned positive to +0.5 V and reversed back to −0.6 V. This was repeated several times.
As shown in Fig. 7 an oxidation wave corresponding to the oxidation of hydroazobenzene to azobenzene is clearly seen at ca. +0.2 V, and on the reverse scan a reduction peak of azobenzene back to hydroazobenzene is observed at −0.3 V which is comparable to that seen for the electrochemical reduction of azobenzene on the edge plane electrode.
Next a modified glassy carbon electrode was investigated in a pH 2 buffer solution.
Shown in Fig. 8 are the cyclic voltammograms for the first (curve A), second (curve B) and tenth (curve C) scans.
On the first scan, two reduction peaks are observed at ca. −0.13 V and −0.4 V (vs. SCE), which again can be assigned to the reduction of azobenzene as two different forms from the electrode surface.
A peak is observed on the oxidation scan corresponding to the oxidation of hydroazobenzene to azobenzene.
On the second scan the latter reduction peak has virtually disappeared suggesting that hydroazobenzene in the form of crystals is dissolved from the electrode surface with a single reduction wave due to the reduction of azobenzene to hydroazobenzene.
The scan rate was varied and a plot of peak current vs. scan rate was found to be linear, consistent with a surface bound species.
The surface concentration of hydrazobenzene on a glassy carbon electrode (after stabilisation, ten scans) was determined using cyclic voltammogram, and was found to be 54.7 (±0.4) × 10−10 mol cm−2.
Cyclic voltammograms for glassy carbon electrode modified with hydrazobenzene were recorded in various buffer solutions in pH range from 2 to 10.
A plot of peak potential against pH was linear with a gradient of 57 mV (pH unit)−1 which is in excellent agreement with expected value for a two-electron, two-proton process.
Next, oxygen reduction at a glassy carbon electrode modified with hydrazobenzene was investigated.
Buffer solutions were saturated with cyclic voltammograms run.
Comparison of oxygen reduction at the modified (Fig. 9, curve B) and bare glassy carbon electrode (Fig. 9, curve C) reveals that the reduction waves shift to a more positive potential with a significantly large increase in the peak current suggesting good electro-activity.
The largest enhancement was observed for pH 2.
All further measurements with hydroazobenzene were carried out in pH 2 phosphate buffer solution.
The catalytic rate constant analysing cyclic voltammetry data via Andrieux and Savéant theory40 was 7.4 × 103 M−1 s−1 for a surface coverage of 54.7 (±0.3) × 10−10 mol cm−2.
Kinetic parameters for the reduction of oxygen on a glassy carbon electrode modified with hydrazobenzene were evaluated via the RDE method (eqn. (7)).
A modified rotating disc GC electrode was placed into an oxygen saturated solution and run at various rotation speeds.
A plot of reciprocal of limiting current versus square root of rotation speed was constructed.
Using the Koutecky–Levich equation with a surface coverage of hydroazobenzene, which was found to be 47.7 (±0.4) × 10−10 mol cm−2 the catalytic rate constant of oxygen reduction was determined to be 7.3 × 103 M−1s−1 which is in excellent agreement with that obtained using cyclic voltammetry.
Next, oxygen reduction under an acoustic field was evaluated.
First however, the stability under ultrasound of the glassy carbon electrode modified with physically adsorbed hydrazobenzene was addressed.
The modified electrode was first exposed to ultrasound of 87 W cm−2 at a horn-to-electrode distance of 10 mm.
Note that this is the highest intensity used in analysis for the catalytic rate constant via use of the modified Koutecky–Levich equation.
Shown in Fig. 10 are the cyclic voltammograms recorded at different time intervals, along with a plot showing the peak current of the hydroazobenzene as a function of time applying an ultrasound intensity of 87 W cm−2.
After 10 min of insonation, the initial peak current before application of ultrasound decreased only ca. 10%, from 19 μA to 17 μA.
For 1 h of insonation a 16% decrease was observed.
Furthermore, 10 min insonation at 36 W cm−2 was found to decrease the voltammetric signal from 23 μA to 21 μA corresponding to a 9% decrease while for 1 h a 10% decrease was observed suggesting that the hydrazobenzene is extremely stable under ultrasound and therefore appropriate as a sonoelectrocatalyst for oxygen reduction and hydrogen peroxide producer.
As in the case of azobenzene modified glassy carbon electrode, the catalytic rate constant of oxygen reduction at glassy carbon electrode modified with hydrazobenzene was calculated from the intercept of the sono-Koutecky–Levich plot.20
The surface coverage of hydrazobenzene before applying ultrasound was found to be 51.7 (±0.3) × 10−10 mol cm−2, while after application of acoustic field it was found to decrease to 48.9 (±0.4) × 10−10 mol cm−2.
Using an average value for the surface coverage, the catalytic rate constant was evaluated to be 8.1 × 103 M−1 s−1.
The combined chemical rate constant obtained was 40.7 × 10−3 cm s−1 which is the same as that found from cyclic voltammetry, differing slightly from the one obtained for RDE method (34.8 × 10−3 cm s−1).
The electro-reduction of fast black K salt (2,5-dimethoxy-4-[(4-nitrophenyl)azo] benzenediazonium tetrachlorozincate) was first explored.
The structure of fast black K is shown in Scheme 1.
As shown in Fig. 11a three reduction waves are observed at +0.15 V, −0.30 V and −0.41 V with an oxidation peak at +0.4 V (vs. SCE).
The two reduction peaks at −0.30 and −0.41 V can be attributed to the reduction of the nitro group of the FBK salt as two different forms on the GC electrode, specifically as a monolayer and as microcrystals, while the first at +0.15 V can be assigned to the reduction of the azo linkages of the fast black K compound with the corresponding oxidation wave at +0.4 V.43
Fig. 11b shows the second scan which clearly shows two reduction waves at ca. +0.15 V and −0.41 V.
The electrochemical behaviour of FBK/GC electrode was examined over a range of potentials at various pHs.
The variation of the (first) peak potential as a function of pH was found to be linear with a slope of 51 mV (pH unit)−1 consistent with a two-proton, two-electron process.
Next an oxygen-saturated solution was prepared with the cyclic voltammetric response recorded.
As shown in Fig. 12, the peak current corresponding to the reduction of oxygen was increased with the peak potential shifting to a more positive potential compared to the unmodified GC electrode.
The biggest increase in peak current was observed in pH 2 solution.
Therefore subsequent measurements were performed at this pH.
A new modified electrode was prepared and found to have a surface coverage of 48.1 (±0.3) × 10−10 mol cm−2.
The catalytic rate constant was evaluated using cyclic voltammetry data via the Andrieux and Savéant theory40 which was found to be 10.4 (±0.1) × 103 M−1 s−1.
For comparison, oxygen reduction at a FBK modified GC electrode was determined by RDE method.
A RDGC electrode was modified as described in section 2.3 and placed into a pH 2 phosphate buffer solution, which was saturated with oxygen.
Using the Koutecky – Levich equation,41 the catalytic rate constant for oxygen reduction was calculated to be 9.9 (±0.1) × 103 M−1 s−1 using a surface coverage of 59.0 (±0.3) × 10−10 mol cm−2.
This value is identical to the one obtained from cyclic voltammetry.
The combined chemical rate parameter was found to be 58.4 × 10−3 cm s−1 for RDE method compared to 50.0 × 10−3 cm s−1 obtained from cyclic voltammetry.
Next, the reduction of oxygen using the FBK modified electrode was explored using sonovoltammetry.
First the stability under ultrasound of the modified glassy carbon electrode was investigated.
The modified electrode was exposed to ultrasound of 87 W cm−2 at fixed horn-to-electrode distance of 10 mm.
Shown in Fig. 13 are the cyclic voltammograms recorded at different time intervals, along with a plot showing the peak current of the FBK as a function of time applying an ultrasound intensity of 87 W cm−2.
After 10 min of insonation, the initial peak current before application of ultrasound decreased only 13.5%, from 12.6 μA to 10.9 μA with an 1 h of insonation resulting in an 18.2% decrease.
When 36 W cm−2 ultrasound intensity was used, 10 min of insonation was found to decrease the voltammetric signal from 9.4 μA to 8.5 μA corresponding to a 9.9% decrease while 1 h insonation produced a 15% decrease.
Clearly the fast black K modified electrode is extremely stable under ultrasound and therefore appropriate as a sonoelectrocatalyst.
The catalytic rate constant of oxygen reduction at a glassy carbon electrode modified with FBK was calculated via the sono-Koutecky–Levich equation.20
The surface coverage of FBK before applying ultrasound was found to be 47.2 × 10−10 mol cm−2, while after application of acoustic field it was found to decrease to 43.7 × 10−10 mol cm−2.
Using an average value for the surface coverage, the catalytic rate constant was evaluated to be 10.9 (±0.1) × 103 M−1 s−1.
The combined chemical rate parameter obtained was 49.5 × 10−3cm s−1 which is almost the same as that found from cyclic voltammetry, 50.0 × 10−3cm s−1.
Table 1 shows the deduced electrocatalytic rate constant and combined chemical rate parameter values for the oxygen reduction on glassy carbon electrodes modified with azobenzene, hydroazobenzene and fast black K salt.
Also included are the values for anthraquinone species previously reported.16
Note that all the data refers to pH 2; faster rates can be found at different pH’s.21
Comparisons of the combined chemical rate parameters for azobenzene and derivatives with the anthraquinone species, reveal that the former is ca. five times faster.
Note that this is the first time these have been investigated for the electrochemical reduction of oxygen.
Furthermore the modified electrodes investigated in this work were more stable under ultrasound and exhibited a more remarkable electro-catalytic activity toward oxygen reduction.
The electrochemical reduction of oxygen using glassy carbon electrodes modified with azobenzene, hydroazobenzene, or fast black K salt (2,5-dimethoxy-4-[(4-nitrophenyl)azo] benzenediazonium tetrachlorozincate) at glassy carbon electrodes have been explored.
The performance of the modified electrodes under ultrasound was found to be highly stable; the superiority of these modified electrodes under insonation over their anthraquinone counterparts19,44 is noted.
The catalytic rate constants of the immobilised species towards oxygen reduction were assessed via cyclic, rotating disc and sono- voltammetry with the values obtained suggesting their use as practical hydrogen peroxide generators.
On the mechanism of the HCCO + O2 reaction: Probing multiple pathways to a single product channel
We explore the mechanism of the HCCO + O2 reaction using time-resolved Fourier transform spectroscopy.
Utilizing an isotopically labeled reactant (18O2) and state-selective product detection, we determine the relative flux through different paths on the potential energy surface leading to a single asymptote: H + CO + CO2.
In the labeled reaction, the dominant isotopic products are C18O and 16OC18O. Combined with data from the corresponding reaction in natural isotopic abundance, these results show that at least 85% of the reactive flux passes through a four-membered OCCO ring intermediate.
An alternative reaction path through an energetically allowed three-membered COO ring intermediate represents less than 15% of the total reactive flux.
The average energy deposited in vibration of CO and CO2 is in reasonable agreement with a statistical model using the separate statistical ensembles method.
The measurement of total rate coefficients, product branching ratios, and product energy distributions are common methods in the elucidation of reaction mechanisms.
Typically, each product branching ratio is interpreted as a measurement of the flux through one exit channel of the reaction.
However, it is possible that two energetically feasible paths on the potential energy surface (PES) lead to a single product channel.
Measuring the contribution of each allowed reaction path toward a given exit channel tests our understanding of both the PES itself, and the calculations carried out on that surface to predict kinetics and dynamics.
In such cases it is usually quite difficult, if not impossible, to experimentally determine the contributions of these multiple reaction paths because they produce identical products.
It is sometimes possible to measure contributions from multiple pathways if energy partitioning in a product molecule depends strongly on the different pathways, but this method may only be viable for the simplest cases.1–3
Isotopic labeling of reactants combined with isotope-specific detection of products offers the possibility of probing contributions of individual reaction paths in addition to more commonly measured product branching ratios.
In this paper, we use this concept to interrogate reaction paths in the HCCO + O2 reaction.
The ketenyl radical (HCCO) is a key intermediate in acetylene oxidation chemistry and consequently an important species in combustion of all hydrocarbons.4–7
HCCO is formed primarily via the reaction of C2H2 + O C2H2 + O(3P) → HCCO + H ΔH0 = −19.6 kcal mol−1,8,9→CH2 + CO ΔH0 = −47.9 kcal mol−1.
Recent measurements of this reaction agree that HCCO + H is the dominant channel at room temperature.10–13
Experimental values of k1a/k1 range from .08510
(285 K), .08311
(290 K), .08013
(900–1200 K) to .06412
(1500–2000 K), while a theoretical calculation predicts a k1a/k1 ratio of 0.7,14 with little temperature or pressure dependence.
The value of this branching ratio is critical in determining the mechanism behind “prompt” CO2 formation in acetylene oxidation.
Prompt CO2, that is, the formation of CO2 with the same time constant as the partially oxidized species CO, was first observed in Kistiakowsky's group in the 1960s.15–18
Eberius et al. observed further evidence of prompt CO2 from measurements in lean C2H2/O2 flames.19
Modeling results from Miller et al20. successfully reproduced these experimental measurements under the assumption that CH2 + CO is the dominant product channel of reaction (1).
However, in light of newer experimental evidence that HCCO + H is the major product channel of reaction (1), Klippenstein, Miller, and Harding21 recently proposed a new model for prompt CO2 formation that centers on oxidation of HCCO HCCO + O2 → H + CO + CO2 ΔH0 = −110.4 kcal mol−1,→OCHCO + O ΔH0 = −1.3 kcal mol−1,→OH + CO + CO ΔH0 = −86.0 kcal mol−122.There are four measurements of the total rate coefficient for this reaction.23–26
Peeters et al11. have suggested that the title reaction occurs though channel (2), while Murray et al25. presented tentative evidence that channel (4) is the major product channel.
Using variational transition state theory master equation calculations and direct trajectory simulations, Klippenstein et al21. predicted that reaction (2) is the dominant product channel of the title reaction for a temperature range of 300–2500 K and pressures up to 100 atm.
Shortly thereafter, Osborn directly observed the HCCO reactant and the CO and CO2 products from the HCCO + O2 reaction using time-resolved Fourier transform emission spectroscopy.27
The emission spectra indicated that the nascent CO and CO2 products are highly internally excited.
No emission from the OH radical was observable, implying that reaction (4) is not a major product channel.
By comparison with a reference reaction that produces OH, the author concluded that the OH + CO + CO channel represents at most 10% of the reaction products27 at 293 K. These results are in agreement with the detailed calculations of Klippenstein et al., which predict that channels (3) and (4) are negligible at room temperature, but may make a small contribution at higher temperatures.
A diagram of the PES for this reaction is presented in Fig. 1.
It is important to distinguish between product channels (2)–(4) and reaction paths (A)–(F) on the PES.
There are three reaction paths (A, C, and D) that lead to H + CO + CO2 products.
These paths involve either a four-membered OCCO ring (III) or a three-membered OCO ring (II) as reaction intermediates.
Similarly, there are two reaction paths (B and F) leading to OH + CO + CO.
Measuring the relative flux on these reaction paths through these intermediates is the focus of this paper.
Isotopic labeling has been widely applied in various fields of chemistry to determine the properties of chemical compounds and their origins and evolutions in reactions.28
This technique can provide important insights into reaction mechanisms and dynamics,29–32 where the same products may arise from several different pathways, although such studies are still scarce.
In order to further elucidate the reaction mechanism of HCCO + O2, we have studied this reaction comparing 18O2 with 16O2 reactants using time-resolved Fourier transform spectroscopy (TR-FTS).
As shown in Fig. 1, products arising from three-membered or four-membered ring intermediates are isotopically distinguishable.
All the possible isotopic variants of CO and CO2 can be easily separated by rotationally-resolved infrared spectroscopy.
The emission spectra of the isotopically labeled products provide a direct measurement of the reactive flux through different reaction pathways.
The vibrational distributions of the products from the emission spectra allow additional insight into the reaction dynamics.
A detailed description of the experimental apparatus has been published previously.27,33
In short, helium is bubbled through a 273 K sample of ethyl ethynyl ether (HCCOC2H5) at 60 sccm.
This flow is combined with O2 (100 sccm) and delivered to a Teflon-lined stainless steel flow cell through a 1.5 cm diameter Pyrex tube.
Ethyl ethynyl ether is photolyzed at 193 nm to produce HCCO + C2H5 with near unit quantum yield.34
The 193 nm photons from an unfocused ArF excimer laser are introduced into the cell about 1 cm below the gas mixture entrance.
Typical laser pulsewidth is 20 ns with a fluence of 24–30 mJ cm−2 pulse−1 at a 50 Hz repetition rate.
Helium (100 sccm) is injected adjacent to the laser windows to minimize chemical deposition on the windows' surfaces.
The pressure of the cell is measured by a capacitance manometer, and maintained at 1.1 Torr through a closed-loop feedback valve throttling the pump.
In order to compare the 16O2 and 18O2 results without variations from long term laser power drift, back to back experiments are performed with either 16O2 or 18O2 flow under the same conditions.
The gas manifold is back filled with helium and pumped out several times to reduce cross contamination before changing O2 isotopes.
The absorption cross section of ethyl ethynyl ether is 7 × 10−18 cm2 molecule−1 at 193 nm.
From the flow rates of different gases, the total pressure of the cell and the absorption cross section of ethyl ethynyl ether at 193 nm, we estimate [HCCO]0 ≅ 8 × 1013 molecules cm−3.
The O2 concentration is fixed at 1.26 × 1016 molecules cm−3, ensuring pseudo-first-order reaction conditions and minimizing secondary reactions of HCCO.
Spectra taken without O2 present have an equal flow of helium substituted for O2 in order to maintain the same sample refreshing rate in the flow cell.
Time-resolved infrared emission is collected by Welsh collection optics,35 made from a pair of 10 cm diameter silver-coated spherical mirrors.
The emission is sent into an evacuated Fourier transform spectrometer (Bruker IFS 66v/S) through a KBr window and focused onto a liquid nitrogen cooled InSb photodiode.
The signal is amplified and digitized by a 16-bit 200 kS s−1 digitizer.
The Fourier spectrometer operates in step-scan mode.36
Time traces of the emission signal are collected and averaged over four laser shots at each mirror position (∼10 000 mirror positions for a 0.115 cm−1 resolution spectrum from 1800 to 2400 cm−1).
The time-resolved interferograms at 5 μs intervals are later extracted from these traces and Fourier transformed into time-resolved spectra.
Data collection begins 20–25 μs prior to the photolysis laser pulse to provide a background noise measurement and a clear reaction starting point (t = 0).
Helium (99.999% Matheson), 16O2 (99.995% Matheson, natural isotopic abundance assumed: 99.76% 16O2, 0.04% 17O2, 0.20% 18O2) and 18O2 (isotopic purity 99%, Isotek) gases are used without further purification.
Unfortunately, the high cost of 18O2 severely limited the amount of signal averaging possible in these experiments, resulting in lower signal-to-noise ratios than we would normally accept.
The limited supply of 18O2 also forced us to use a slower gas flow rate than previously utilized.27
The flow rate still ensures complete flushing of the laser interaction region between laser shots.
However, the cold gas filter effect (absorption of emission by ground state stable molecules) may perturb the populations slightly since the optical path of the Welch collection optics covers a large volume of the cell in addition to the laser interaction region.
Ethyl ethynyl ether is obtained from Aldrich as a 40% solution in hexane and used without further purification.
Hexane has a negligible absorption cross-section at 193 nm, and therefore does not affect the radical production method.
Note that the C2H5 cofragment produced by the photolysis laser will react with O2, but does not produce CO or CO2, and hence does not affect the present measurements37.
HCCO radicals produced from ethyl ethynyl ether photodissociation at 193 nm are internally excited and emit strongly in the 1800–2040 cm−1 region.27
This emission arises from the Δυ2 = −1 asymmetric stretch bands of HCCO.38
Unfortunately, HCCO absorbs very strongly at the photolysis wavelength (193 nm), dissociating to produce CH and vibrationally excited CO.39
The infrared emission from HCCO and this photolytically-produced CO overlap with the emission produced by products of the HCCO + O2 reaction.
Fortunately, CO from HCCO photodissociation can be easily removed by subtracting spectra taken with and without O2 present.
We observe that excited HCCO radicals are quenched in less than 15 μs, and that the quenching rate of HCCO is independent of O2 and He concentration, indicating that the excited HCCO radicals are mainly quenched by hexane and/or ethyl ethynyl ether under the present experimental conditions.
Furthermore, vibrational relaxation of CO by O2 and He is very slow.
Therefore, the background subtraction procedure is expected to completely remove the emission from the excited HCCO and photolytically-produced CO without introducing any bias to the signals from the HCCO + O2 reaction.
All spectra are background subtracted using this method.
Because CH radicals are also produced in the photodissociation of HCCO, it is important to consider their effect on the system.
Although CH does react with O2, producing both CO and CO2 with branching ratios of 0.5 and 0.3 respectively,40 no evidence has been observed that the CH + O2 reaction plays a significant role in CO and CO2 production in the current experiments.27
Specifically, the rate coefficient for CH + O2 at 300 K is 4.7 × 10−11 cm3 molecule−1 s−1,41 corresponding to a rise time of ∼2 μs for products from this reaction at the O2 concentrations in this experiment.
No production of CO or CO2 is observed on this timescale.
Instead, it is likely that most CH radicals react with ethyl ethynyl ether and/or hexane.
The reactions of CH with large hydrocarbons are extremely rapidly (1–2 orders of magnitude faster than the CH + O2 reaction at room temperature)42 and these reactions are unlikely to produce CO or CO2.
In the HCCO + O2 reaction, CO and CO2 are formed with significant vibrational excitation, such that their spectra overlap.27
Efficient cooling of CO2, by vibrational energy transfer to the bath gas, causes its spectrum to blue shift until at t = 300 μs it no longer overlaps the CO transitions.
The HCCO + O2 reaction has a half-life time of ∼80 μs24–26 under the current experimental conditions.
Therefore, at t = 300 μs the reaction is essentially complete.
To simplify quantification of the different isotopic products, we analyze spectra at this long delay time.
Note that by observing both CO and CO2, we obtain two independent measurements of 18O positions in the reaction products.
Emission spectra of the CO product from the HCCO + 16O2 and HCCO + 18O2 reactions at t = 300 μs are shown in Figs. 2 and 3 respectively.
In both figures the upper panels show the experimental data along with a non-linear least squares fit33 and residuals of emission intensity.
The lower panels show a narrower wavelength region to clarify the spectroscopic differences between C16O and C18O and the agreement between the experimental data and the fits.
When we fit the emission spectra allowing contributions from both CO isotopes, we find the only detectable carbon monoxide products of HCCO + 16O2 and HCCO + 18O2 are C16O and C18O respectively.
An upper limit of the branching ratio of C16O in the HCCO + 18O2 reaction will be given later based on the signal-to-noise ratio of the data.
The validity of the background subtraction method is verified in the case of the HCCO + 18O2 reaction, where the entire C16O signal is removed upon background subtraction, implying that all C16O signals in the raw data arise from HCCO photodissociation.
The vibrational distributions of CO derived from the fitting are shown in Fig. 4.
The emission spectra of CO2 from the HCCO + 16O2 and HCCO + 18O2 reactions are shown in Figs. 5–7.
Fig. 5 shows spectra acquired early in the reaction (t = 25 μs) that do not show any resolved rotational lines, but provide a good picture of the nascent vibrational energy of the CO2 product.
The contributions from CO have been removed from Fig. 5 by a procedure described below.
At t = 300 μs, CO2 has cooled sufficiently that few vibrational bands are populated, and the emission bands are rotationally resolved, as shown in Figs. 6 and 7.
Rotational resolution is critical in determining the relative abundance of each CO2 isotope.
Only 16OC16O emission is seen in the natural abundance case, and only 16OC18O emission in the labeled reaction.
No emission from 18OC18O is observed.
The nonlinear least-squares fitting procedure for CO has been described in detail previously.33
Transition energies are calculated from the spectroscopic constants for both C16O and C18O.43
Initially we fit spectra at t = 300 μs, where CO2 emission does not overlap CO emission.
Rotational relaxation of CO is extremely fast and is expected to reach equilibrium in less than 1 μs under the current experimental conditions.44
At t ≥ 5 μs, the rotational distribution for each vibrational band does in fact fit a rotational Boltzmann distribution.
The population of each vibrational level is allowed to vary independently during the nonlinear least-squares fitting to obtain the best fit to each experimental spectrum.
Either a fixed rotational temperature of 330 K for all vibrational bands is used, or the rotational temperature for each individual vibrational state is allowed to vary during the fitting procedure.
The average fitted rotational temperature is 330 ± 50 K, and the quality of the fits is unchanged if the rotational temperature is fixed at this value.
This rotational temperature is slightly higher than the ambient room temperature, which is expected considering the energy deposited in the system by the laser and the heat of reaction.
Considering the enthalpy change (ΔH = hν − D0(HCCO—C2H5) + |ΔH0(ch.
2)|) along with the heat capacities and mole fractions of the major species, we calculate a temperature increase of 25–35 K, depending on the value assumed for the heat capacity of HCCOC2H5.
This temperature change is in good agreement with the spectroscopic rotational temperature of CO derived from the fitting.
Because C16O is not observed in the HCCO + 18O2 reaction, we evaluate the upper limit of C16O formation with an analysis similar to the one used for OH yield estimation.27
The absorption intensities of the υ′ = 1 ← υ″ = 0 transition of C16O and C18O show that the two isotopes have essentially equal Einstein A coefficients.45
Therefore the emission intensity of the two CO isotopes should be proportional to the absolute number densities of the emitting species.
Because the vibrational distributions of C16O and C18O can be approximately described by Boltzmann distributions with similar vibrational temperatures, the emission intensities are expected to be proportional to the total CO number density, including the ground vibrational state.
In the present experiments, the product of vibrational state population with the Einstein A coefficient is largest for the υ′ = 2 band, making it the most sensitive transition for CO detection.
Beginning with the best-fit population distribution (which contains only C18O), we manually increase the population of C16O in the spectral simulation until several peaks originating in υ′ = 2 can be distinguished from the background.
This analysis provides an upper limit of [C16O]/[C18O] < 0.16 in the HCCO + 18O2 reaction.
While emission from CO is rotationally resolved at all reaction times, CO2 emission is rotationally resolved only at later times.
The fitting of CO2 emission spectra is more complicated because of the presence of three vibrational modes, vibrational angular momentum, and the effect of nuclear spin.
Given the 1800–2400 cm−1 spectral window observed in these experiments, only transitions in the antisymmetric stretch bands, i.e. (mnlp) → (mnlp − 1), need be considered.
The spectroscopic constants for C16O2, 16OC18O and 18OC18O are adopted from refs. 46 and 47.
The fitting of CO2 spectra at long delay times (e.g., 300 μs) indicates that only the lowest few vibrational states are populated.
The magnified regions in Figs. 6 and 7 clearly show that the different isotopes of CO2 can be resolved.
The only CO2 isotope observed in HCCO + 18O2 is 16OC18O. Our detection sensitivity for CO2 is lower than for CO because so many more initial states are populated in the case of the triatomic molecule.
Nevertheless, a similar analysis to that described above for CO indicates a limit of [18OC18O]/[16OC18O] < 0.30.
This value is likely significantly overestimated due to the poor signal-to-noise ratio of the CO2 emission spectra.
In order to estimate the nascent product vibrational state distributions, the overlapping emission of CO and CO2 at early times should ideally be separated.
However, a good approximation to the nascent CO product state distribution can be measured at t = 300 μs because CO cools very slowly due to collisions.
Using a process described below, we can also fit the CO distribution at early times when interference from CO2 is substantial.
The resulting CO vibrational distributions, shown in Fig. 4, can for simplicity be fit to a Boltzmann distribution, yielding temperatures of 8600 ± 900 K and 9500 ± 1000 K for C16O and C18O respectively.
The vibrational distributions of CO are similar for both C16O and C18O. The distributions on a Boltzmann plot are somewhat non-linear, with greater population in higher vibrational levels than a true vibrational temperature would allow.
Note that the early time C16O distribution in Fig. 4 appears quite linear, while the population of higher vibrational levels of C16O seems to increase by t = 300 μs.
Most of this variation can be attributed to the less than optimal signal-to-noise ratio of the data.
As discussed above, the high cost of 18O2 limited signal averaging in the present experiments.
To facilitate comparisons between isotopes, the reaction using 16O2 is executed with the same limited averaging times.
Earlier data on the HCCO + 16O2 reaction,27 utilizing more signal averaging, provide a more precise representation of the C16O vibrational distribution, and display curvature in the Boltzmann plot that is intermediate between all the data presented in Fig. 4.
While this distribution could be described as bimodal, we hesitate to draw conclusions based on bimodality without substantially more data collection over a range of total pressures.
It is important to note that curvature in the vibrational distribution has no impact on the isotope ratios discussed in section IIIA.
Since the Boltzmann vibrational temperatures for the two CO isotopes are within mutual uncertainty, we conclude that different oxygen isotopes have little effect on the vibrational distribution of CO. The derived vibrational temperatures are consistent with the previous result of 8500 ± 800 K.27
The much more rapid vibrational energy transfer from CO2 requires that its nascent distribution be measured at the earliest reaction time with sufficient signal (t = 25 μs in this case).
To meaningfully fit the broad CO2 emission at this early time requires both a robust method for removing the sharp features due to CO, and a spectroscopic model of highly excited CO2.
To remove the early-time CO spectral features, we first fit one CO spectrum at t = 300 μs, where CO2 does not interfere.
We then separate all time-resolved spectra into two regions by determining where CO could contribute to the total emission (i.e., near a known CO line) and where the emission must be solely due to CO2.
Explicitly, these “separated” experimental spectra can be represented by the following equations, where I(,t) is the emission intensity as a function of wavenumber and δ is the experimental root-mean-square (RMS) noise: Eqn. (6) retains all wavenumbers in the spectra where CO emission intensity is expected to be lower than the RMS noise.
Therefore, contains emission solely from CO2, while has contributions from both CO and CO2.
The small gaps in are bridged using linear interpolation to obtain a continuous CO2 emission spectrum for each delay time in the data sets.
This method is attractive because it does not require any a priori assumption as to the time-dependent shape of the broad CO2 emission.
Because only the accurately known rovibrational line positions of CO are involved in this treatment, we obtain the least biased separation of CO and CO2 emissions.
Because the CO2 emission spectrum at short delay times is not rotationally resolved, our spectroscopic model uses a resolution of 4 cm−1.
We assume a Boltzmann rotational distribution at 330 K and a Boltzmann vibrational distribution.
While the nascent CO2 vibrational state distribution may be far from statistical, fast internal vibrational redistribution (IVR) of CO2, due to Fermi resonances and high vibrational state density,48 is expected to redistribute the vibrational energy statistically among the three vibrational modes on a time scale less than our temporal resolution.
The fit has two parameters: vibrational temperature and total intensity.
The early spectra of CO2 indicate that vibrational states as high as υ3 ∼ 18 can contribute to the wavelength region where we observe emission.
Because of the anharmonicity and rotation-vibration interaction constants related to the υ3 mode, the population of υ1 and υ2 (symmetric stretch and bend modes) cannot be neglected.
The maximum quantum numbers for the υ1, υ2, and υ3 modes in the fit are 30, 65, and 25 respectively.
As in the rotationally resolved fitting, only (mnlp) → (mnlp − 1) transitions are included.
Emission spectra of CO2 at t = 25–185 μs are fit using the low-resolution model.
Fig. 5 shows representative experimental spectra and corresponding fits.
The residuals in Figs. 5–7 are generally comparable to the baseline noise away from spectral features.
The increased residuals in the lower panel of Fig. 5 may indicate that our spectroscopic model of hot CO2 is too simplistic, but we believe the data do not justify a more complex model.
The temporal evolution of CO2 vibrational temperature is well fit by a single exponential curve as shown in Fig. 8.
The vibrational temperatures obtained are 5900 ± 500 K and 6300 ± 500 K for nascent C16O2 and 16OC18O respectively by extrapolating the exponential fitting to t = 0.
The possible outcomes of the HCCO + 18O2 labeled reaction can be considered with reference to Fig. 1 and the work of Klippenstein et al.21
Kinetic isotope effects are expected to be negligible due to the small mass difference between the two oxygen isotopes, and the large exothermicity of the observed product channels.
In this case the isotopic labeling provides a means to distinguish different reaction paths without significantly affecting the reactivity of the system.
As O2 approaches HCCO, a barrier at saddle point 1 (sp1) arises because the addition of O2 breaks the resonance stabilization in HCCO.
The initial adduct (I) can dissociate along two different reaction coordinates to yield H(18O)CC16O + 18O (path E) or, with an energetically expensive H atom transfer, 18OH + C16O + C18O (path F).
Theoretical calculations indicate that these two pathways are of very minor importance at room temperature due to the high potential energy barriers sp2 and sp.321
In light of these calculations, we expect that only paths A–D, which yield product channels 2 and 4, have the possibility to contribute at room temperature.
The unpaired electron on oxygen in the initial adduct (I) may attack either carbon atom, forming a three-member (II) or resonantly stabilized four-member (III) ring intermediate.
The barrier to ring closing is higher for (II) than for (III), but the formation of a three-member ring involves less of an entropy penalty.
It is therefore not obvious which pathway will be more favorable.
The dissociation of the three-member ring intermediate (II) occurs through C–C bond cleavage along path D. HC18O2 (IV) is at most only marginally bound,49 and will dissociate giving the final products H + 18OC18O + C16O.
In comparison, decomposition of the four-member ring intermediate may proceed through three different paths (A–C).
In all cases, O–O bond fission occurs first over sp5, leading to an 18OCHC(18O)16O complex (the flat region near −94 kcal mol−1).
The barrier to C–C bond fission in this complex is essentially zero, and it may dissociate directly via path A to HC18O + 16OC18O. HC18O will almost certainly dissociate over sp8 due to the great exothermicity of this product channel, yielding finally H + C18O + 16OC18O. However, the direct dynamics classical trajectory calculations of ref. 21. provide evidence of two additional paths for decomposition of III.
Following O–O bond fission over sp5, the hydrogen atom may transfer to the unpaired electron on the 16O atom.
If the C–C bond lives long enough for internal rotation about this bond, the H atom could also transfer to the 18O atom in the CO2 moiety.
In either case, after the H transfer the ensuing C–C bond fission leads to HOCO + CO (V), with isotope labels shown in Fig. 1.
The HOCO radical will almost certainly dissociate because of the great exothermicity of the reaction.
This dissociation, and the corresponding reaction OH + CO, has been studied extensively.50,51
There are two possible dissociation channels of HOCO: OH + CO and H + CO2.
The OH + CO → HOCO reaction has a loose transition state, and may have a slight entrance barrier, while H + CO2 → HOCO has a tight transition state.
High level ab initio calculations have located saddle points on the HOCO → CO2 + H potential, which are 1.5 and 7.8 kcal mol−1 above the HO + CO asymptote for cis and trans HOCO respectively.52
Variational transition state theory rate coefficient calculations53 predict that these two dissociation channels are almost equally important with 1 kcal mol−1 energy above the OH + CO asymptote.
However, the OH + CO channel quickly becomes the dominant reaction channel and remains about an order of magnitude faster than H + CO2 as energy increases.
Since the reaction of HCCO + O2 is highly exothermic, we expect that H + CO2 would be a minor channel of HOCO dissociation.
Note, however, that path C cannot be distinguished from path A using the present isotopic labels.
Therefore, if we ignore the possibility of internal rotation about the C–C bond as (III) dissociates, the resulting isotopic intermediate is H16OC18O + C18O, which leads to 16OH + C18O + C18O. At the other limit, if rotation about the C–C bond were facile as (III) dissociates, the final products would be a mixture of 18OH + C16O + C18O and 16OH + C18O + C18O with a relative ratio of 1∶1, as indicated in Fig. 1.
Given these possible paths on the potential energy surface, we now evaluate the constraints placed on the flux through these paths by the experimental data.
Assuming that paths C, E, and F are negligible, as discussed above, we can draw the following connections between the product rate coefficients and the path-specific rate coefficients for this reaction: k2 = kA + kD,k4 = kB,ktot = k2 + k4 = kA + kD + kB, where ktot is the total rate coefficient.
Note that k2, the rate coefficient for H + CO + CO2 production, may contain contributions from both the three- and four-member ring intermediates.
The data place three constraints on these equations: two isotope ratios measured in this work, [C16O]/[C18O] < 0.16 and [18OC18O]/[16OC18O] < 0.30, and the limit on total OH production (kB/ktot) < 0.10 from .ref. 27
The quantities we wish to obtain are the fractions of flux through the three- and four-member ring pathways: Φ3-mem = (kD/ktot) and Φ4-mem = 1 − Φ3-mem.
The CO2 isotopic ratio yields the most straightforward analysis.
Because only paths A and D produce CO2, we have [18OC18O]/[16OC18O] = kD/kA < 0.3, and therefore kD/(kA + kD) < 0.23.
In the limit that 100% of the reaction produces CO2 (i.e., (kB/ktot) = 0) we have simply Φ3-mem = kD/(kA + kD) < 0.23.
At the other limit, if 90% of the total reaction produces CO2 (i.e., (kB/ktot) = 0.1) the flux through the three-member ring becomes The conservative estimate based on the CO2 isotope ratio is therefore Φ3-mem < 0.23.
An evaluation based on the CO isotope ratios is somewhat more complicated because every possibility produces either one or two CO molecules.
If internal rotation of the CO2 moiety about the C–C bond as (III) dissociates is slow, the H atom can only transfer to the 16O atom along path B, and we have In the limit that k4 = kB = 0, we obtain Φ3-mem = (kD/ktot) < 0.14, while for (kB/ktot) = 0.1 the result increases slightly to Φ3-mem = (kD/ktot) < 0.15.
Finally, if internal rotation of the CO2 moiety about the C–C bond as (III) dissociates is fast, the H atom may transfer with equal probability to 16O or 18O along path B. In this case 25% of the CO produced along path B is C16O, and we have As before, in the limit that k4 = kB = 0, we obtain Φ3-mem = (kD/ktot) < 0.14, but in contrast, for (kB/ktot) = 0.1 the result decreases to Φ3-mem = (kD/ktot) < 0.10.
Overall, the conservative result from the CO spectra is Φ3-mem < 0.15, which is somewhat more restrictive than the result obtained from the CO2 spectra, as expected from their worse signal-to-noise ratio.
In summary, we find that at least 85% of the total reactive flux passes through the four-member ring intermediate.
Path A is the dominant reaction path, and H atom transfer during dissociation of (III) plays at most a minor role.
These results agree qualitatively with the rate constants and the 209 direct dynamic trajectories calculated by Klippenstein et al.21
Our reaction path analysis depends strongly on the signal-to-noise ratio of the data.
The accuracy of our derived limits could be improved with better quality data, which is limited primarily by the cost of 18O2.
The vibrational temperatures of CO and CO2 extracted from the data are 9050 (average of C16O and C18O) and 6100 K (average of 16OC18O and 16OC16O) respectively, which correspond to average vibrational energies of 15.7 and 43.6 kcal mol−1 for CO and CO2 respectively.
We have modeled the energy partitioning in this channel using the separate statistical ensembles (SSE) method.54
The SSE model is a refined phase space theory (PST), in which the vibrational branching is defined early in the dissociation, and the coupling between vibrations is assumed to be small for the remainder of the dissociation process.
The rotational distributions are then statistically distributed using PST within each vibrational reservoir.
The SSE model is usually applied to unimolecular photodissociation in which the products have no recombination barrier.
In the present reaction, while the barriers to decomposition of the four-membered ring intermediate are small, the overall reaction is exothermic, in contrast to unimolecular dissociation.
Nevertheless, we have applied this model to the HCCO + O2 reaction because it is straightforward to implement and provides a first assessment of the degree to which the system behaves statistically.
In the HCCO + O2 reaction, the four-membered ring intermediate dissociation along path A involves two bond cleavages.
According to Klippenstein et al.'s calculation,21 the step-wise dissociation occurs with O–O bond fission prior to C–C bond fission.
The barrier height for O–O bond breaking (sp5) is less than 4 kcal mol−1 while there is no barrier for the subsequent C–C bond breaking.
Furthermore, the barrier to formation of the four-member ring intermediate (sp4) is even smaller than sp5.
While there is a small exit barrier (sp8) to dissociation of HCO,55 this barrier is also small compared to the available energy.
It is worth noting that a modified statistical model was required to describe HCO dissociation at low and intermediate energies above the dissociation threshold56 because its low density of states leads to slow IVR.57
However, these nonstatistical effects are expected to be less important at high HCO internal energy.
Because the excess reaction energy is significantly larger than all these barrier heights on the PES of the HCCO + O2 reaction, the SSE method may still be applicable for the four-membered ring intermediate decomposition and subsequent HCO dissociation.
In order to evaluate the CO vibrational energy distribution, a two-step reaction mechanism was assumed for the four-membered ring intermediate: dissociation to HCO + CO2 (VI), followed by HCO → H + CO.
The available energy for the first step is the energy difference between the HCCO + O2 reactants and HCO + CO2, 126.0 kcal mol−1.
The available energy for the second step is the internal energy of HCO minus the H—CO bond enthalpy.
The small exit barrier of HCO dissociation (sp8) is ignored in the SSE calculation.
For each HCO vibrational level, the corresponding CO vibrational state distribution is calculated.
The population of each vibrational state of CO is summed over all the possible HCO vibrational energies to obtain the final CO vibrational state distribution.
The vibrational frequencies for HCO are adopted from .ref. 58
The SSE method is only performed for 16O isotopes in the current study.
Since the model is only sensitive to the final product vibrational frequencies, and this frequency difference is small for 16O and 18O isotopes, the results of 18O isotopes are expected to be very similar to 16O.
The predicted average vibrational energies from the SSE method are 48.2 kcal mol−1 for CO2, and 15.8 kcal mol−1 for CO, respectively, in reasonable agreement with the experimental values.
The CO vibrational state distribution obtained from the SSE model is shown in Fig. 4.
The predicted product state distribution is in qualitative, but not quantitative agreement with experimental results.
One interpretation of the highly excited CO2 and CO vibrational state distributions observed in this reaction is that the large geometry changes between the four-membered ring intermediate and the separated products lead to significant Franck–Condon excitation of product vibrational modes.
However, the reasonable agreement between experiment and the SSE model implies that a statistical description is sufficient to explain the experimental results, due to the large exothermicity of the reaction and strong coupling between vibrational degrees of freedom as the intermediate dissociates.
We have studied the reaction HCCO + 18O2 using time-resolved Fourier spectroscopy.
The observed C18O and 16OC18O emission spectra indicate that the reaction occurs primarily through a four-membered ring intermediate.
Spectral fits yield the limits Φ3-mem < 15% and Φ4-mem > 85% for the total reactive flux through the two possible ring intermediates.
Hydrogen transfer during decomposition of the four-membered ring intermediate is a minor process.
The CO and CO2 products are found to be highly vibrationally excited with vibrational temperatures of 9050 ± 1400 K and 6100 ± 700 K respectively.
The average vibrational energy deposited in CO and CO2 is reasonably well predicted by the separate statistical ensembles (SSE) method, implying that statistical rather than dynamical effects dominate this reaction mechanism.
Missing pieces of the puzzle or about some unresolved issues in solid state chemistry of alkali metal aluminohydrides
The paper discusses some unresolved issues in the solid state chemistry of alkali metal aluminohydrides (alanates) relevant to high-capacity hydrogen storage.
Analysis of experimental data available in chemical and materials science literature suggests a one-step mechanism for the thermal decomposition of both pure and Ti-doped aluminohydrides.
Most likely, the presence of a titanium hydride phase in the catalyst is responsible for the catalytic effect of Ti-additives.
Furthermore, ball-milling promotes chemical and phase transformations of solid alanates by enhancing mass transfer in the material and creating high-pressure spots where pressure-driven chemical reactions can take place.
For almost a century, aluminum hydride and complex alkali metal aluminohydrides (also called alanates) have been known as powerful reducing agents, propellants, and precursors for aluminum coatings.1
From time to time, they have also been evaluated as possible hydrogen storage media but removed from the list of potential candidates due to irreversibility of pure hydrides.2
However, the situation changed when it became clear that conventional hydrogen storage systems are unable to provide storage capacities in excess of 6 wt.% of H2 and operate around 80–100 °C, i.e. at the working temperatures of modern Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells.3,4
In 1997, B. Bogdanovic and M. Schwickardi5 used the ability of alkali metal hydrides to react with aluminum and hydrogen in the presence of titanium additives6,7 and developed a new type of reversible hydrogen storage media that were operational at moderate hydrogen pressures and temperatures.2NaH + 2Al + 3H2 → 2NaAlH4 (Ti catalyst)In the years that followed, Ti-doped alanates have developed into materials capable of reversibly storing at least 4% of hydrogen by the weight below 125 °C.8
Also, the decomposition temperature of lithium aluminohydride has been reduced to room temperature by combining a metal additive (TiCl4) with mechanical processing—an approach that allowed tuning of hydrogen release from alanate-based materials.9,10
Despite the clear advances of the last years, the demonstrated hydrogen storage capacities of metal-doped alanates remain unsatisfactorily low, which explains the recent pessimism regarding the target number of 6+ wt.% of H2 in NaAlH4-based systems.3,10,11
In addition, solid state events occurring in alkali metal aluminohydrides remain poorly understood10,12,15 so that the puzzle portraying their conduct in the condensed phase still misses a number of crucial pieces.
In the paper below, we will briefly review three major issues in the solid state chemistry of aluminohydrides—thermal decomposition, solid state transformations in the presence of titanium salts, and mechanically induced solid state reactions—and propose a non-conventional interpretation of known experimental facts, which may help in locating those missing pieces.
Simultaneously, this paper is intended to attract the attention of the research community to the ideas which have been left out of mainstream research during the last decade.
Since the early 1970s the thermal decomposition of alkali metal aluminohydrides MAlH4, where M = Li, Na, K or Cs, has been described as a multi-step process, which begins with melting of the aluminohydride and proceeds through an intermediate formation of an alkali metal hexahydroaluminate, M3AlH6 to the metal hydride (MH), aluminum and hydrogen [eqns.
(1)–(3)]13.MAlH4(s) → MAlH4(liq)3MAlH4(liq) → M3AlH6(s) + 2Al(s) + 3H2(g)2M3AlH6(s) → 6MH (s) + 2Al(s) + 3H2(g)Since the transformation of the tetrahedral [AlH4]− ion into the octahedral [AlH6]3− ion is associated with complex structural re-arrangements, melting of hydrides is believed to be a vital step in the decomposition process.14
Although very attractive, this mechanism has never been unambiguously confirmed.
It was formulated by Dilts and Ashby based on the results of thermal gravimetric (TGA) and differential thermal analyses (DTA) (Table 1).
However, both techniques were unable to provide information about chemical and phase composition of the sample.13
Furthermore, TGA and gas-volumetric (GV) measurements reported later turned out to be surprisingly ‘inaccurate’, departing from theoretically predicted numbers on hydrogen evolution by 10% and more.10,13–15,23
Also, recent in situ X-ray and neutron diffraction studies have merely confirmed the presence of a M3AlH6 phase in decomposing samples without addressing their exact composition.15,16
The later is extremely important, however, since deviations in the content of M3AlH6 in the decomposing sample from the values predicted by eqn. (2) clearly indicate shortcomings of the theory.
Finally, traditional mechanism completely failed to explain how and why metal-doped lithium and sodium aluminohydrides can quickly decompose at temperatures much lower than their melting points.5,8–10,18,19
It is no surprise, therefore, that when quantitative analytical techniques, such as the solid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, were finally applied to the studies of alkali metal alanates, the inconsistency of eqns. (1)–(3) became quite obvious.
Thus, investigation of solid lithium aluminohydride using the solid state 27Al nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (the solid state 27Al NMR)18–20 revealed a gradual thermal decomposition of the pure LiAlH4 in the solid state without melting (Fig. 1).
This observation also agrees with neutron diffraction studies performed independently.16
The same investigation has also showed that actual concentration of Li3AlH6 phase in the sample during solid state decomposition is considerably lower than is predicted by eqn. (2).
Remarkably, a very similar observation was also made when melted LiAlH4 was investigated using a liquid-state27Al NMR spectroscopy.21
An interesting fact has been reported by Grochala and Edwards who tried to correlate decomposition temperatures (Tdec) of Li, Na and K aluminohydrides with their ΔH°dec.10
Unexpectedly, researchers failed to find a reasonable fit for ΔH°dec derived from eqn. (2).
On the contrary, Tdec and ΔH°dec perfectly agreed with one another when ΔH°dec were obtained from eqn. (4) (Table 2), that is, from the equation representing an alternative route of the thermal decomposition of alkali metal aluminohydrides.2MAlH4(s) → 2MH (s) + 2Al(s) + 3H2(g)MAlH4(s) + 2MH (s) → M3AlH6(s)M = alkali metalIt is worth noting that Dilts and Ashby13 also considered eqns. (4) and (5) as possible scenario for the thermal decomposition of alkali metal aluminohydrides.
They even presented some experimental evidence supporting decomposition of LiAlH4 directly to LiH and Al, but finally went for an alternative model.
The reason for their decision was that solid state reaction (5) looked unlikely at that time.13
Another mechanism of the thermal decomposition of alkali metal aluminohydrides can be found in the recent paper by Walters et al.,17 who believe that thermal transformations of sodium aluminohydride begin with its dissociation into sodium hydride and aluminum hydride.
Further, NaH reacts with starting NaAlH4, giving rise to Na3AlH6; AlH3 decomposes into Al and H2 [eqns.
(6)–(11)].MAlH4 → MH + AlH3NaH + NaAlH4 → [Na2AlH5]NaH + [Na2AlH5] → Na3AlH6Na3AlH6 → 3NaH + AlH3AlH3 → Al + 3H2H → H2Indeed, AlH3 is thermally sensitive and quickly decomposes into Al and H2 between 110 and 150 °C making the sequence eqns. (6)–(10) feasible.10,22
On the other hand, AlH3 has never been detected in alkali metal aluminohydrides, neither by scattering techniques nor by NMR, nor by any other direct analytical technique.
Thus, if aluminum hydride forms during the decomposition process, it should be a part of the transition/intermediate state rather than an independent constituent.
The experimental data collected to date are completely consistent with the thermal decomposition of alkali metal aluminohydrides in the solid state.
Any discrepancies between theory and experiment disappear if the decomposition process is described as a one-step event [eqn.
(4)] without intermediate formation of alkali metal hexahydroaluminates.
However, a hexahydroaluminate can form in the decomposing material according to eqn. (5) in amounts contingent upon the rates of all competing processes.
The concentration of M3AlH6 in the sample may even agree with eqn. (2) if reaction (5) is much faster than reaction (4), that is, when hydride MH is consumed faster than MAlH4 decomposes.
Otherwise, the amounts of hydrogen released on separate decomposition stages would deviate from those predicted by eqns. (2) and (3).
Finally, when decomposition of MAlH4 is tracked by DTA/TGA or gas volumetric techniques, M3AlH6 forming in the side-reaction (5) collapses at elevated temperatures [eqn.
(3)] thus creating a perfect illusion of the multi-step process.
An assumption10,20 that the thermal decomposition of alkali metal aluminohydrides is a one-step process leads to several conclusions which may considerably influence future research in the area.
According to the fundamental principle of micro-reversibility of chemical reactions, the forward reaction and the backward reaction pass through the same activated state.25
Therefore, in an ideal case, the re-charging of an alanate-based material could follow the path reverse to its decomposition, that is, re-charging of a decomposed alanate should produce MAlH4 directly from MH, Al and H2.
In reality, however, solid state reactions such as transformations of metal hydrides involve a set of elementary processes, which are located in various zones of the solid; for instance, adsorption, surface reactions, diffusions and some other processes.
An example is shown in Fig. 2, where the solid state reaction AH → A + H (gas) proceeds differently from the reverse process.
The molecules of gas H are desorbed from the surface of AH in the case of the direct reaction (also through cracks in the layer of A formed) while they must be absorbed on the phase AH and have to penetrate it before they reach the surface of A in the reverse process.
On the other hand, this controversy can be resolved once the layer of AH is removed from the surface of A by means of a mechanical treatment such as ball-milling.
Second, the formation of alkali metal hexahydroaluminates during hydrogen absorption and desorption cycles should be attributed to the reverse reaction (3) and to the reaction (5), i.e. side-processes, which reduce effective storage capacities of hydrogen absorbers.
Since alkali metal hexahydroaluminates are thermodynamically more stable than corresponding aluminohydrides, they can build up in the material during charge–discharge cycles—a phenomenon recently reported by Srinivasan et al.26
Finally, the maximal storage capacity of an alanate-based material can only be reached if the reversible reaction (4) becomes dominant over any other process.
This may be achieved using an appropriate treatment and a catalyst that selectively enhances reaction rates in eqn. (4) and decelerates other adverse processes.
Indeed, a number of transition metals promote solid state decomposition of complex aluminohydrides; titanium is the most efficient among the known catalysts3–5,7–12,18,23,26,27.
Since the late 1990s, Ti-doped alkali metal aluminohydrides have attracted considerable attention as potential ultra-high capacity hydrogen storage media.3,4,8,10,11,19,27
Currently, a substantial part of hydrogen storage research is dedicated to titanium-doped lithium and sodium alanates and the number of publications dealing with these hydrogen absorbers is constantly growing.10,27
Thus, it has been found that TiCl4, TiCl3 and some other Ti derivatives catalyze hydrogen release and uptake by sodium and lithium alanates and considerably reduce their decomposition temperatures.5,8–12,15,18,19
In addition, it turned out that Ti-doped NaAlH4 can reversibly store about 4 wt.% of H2 and maintain its storage capacity upon prolonged cycling.11,26,27
Furthermore, when metal catalysis is combined with mechanical processing, the decomposition of alkali metal alanates becomes tunable.10,19
Those and other related studies published recently have been summarized in several reviews,3,4,8,10,11,19,27 which can be looked up for further details.
Here, we would like to address only one issue that became a source of continuous controversies; namely, the nature of chemical substances responsible for catalytic effect of titanium in alkali metal aluminohydrides.
Almost all research groups active in the field, tried to resolve this problem.3,4,8,10,11,19,27
Several guesses regarding the nature of the Ti-catalyst had been made15,28,29 and rejected.30,31
As a result, deficiency of constructive knowledge was admitted on several occasions.4,10,12,15
In 2000, one of us reported the decomposition of LiAlH4 at room temperature upon ball-milling in the presence of a catalytic amount of TiCl4.9
Further experiments revealed that TiCl4 and LiAlH4 react under mechanical activation, producing microcrystalline LiCl, Al and an Al3Ti alloy.18,19
Assuming that Al3Ti might be responsible for the catalytic effect of TiCl4, we proposed the mechanism of Ti-catalyzed transformations in solid LiAH4:TiCl4 + 4LiAlH4 → Ti + 4LiCl + 4Al + 8H2Ti + 4Al → Al3Ti + Al2LiH + LiAlH4 → Li3AH6Subsequently, other researchers confirmed our hypothesis by repeating some of our experiments, and finding Al3Ti in the Ti-doped sodium alanate.12,27,30,32–35
For a while, it appeared that Ti-catalyzed transformations of Li/NaAlH4 were finally understood.
Unfortunately, additional studies revealed poor catalytic activity of both the tetragonal DO22-type Al3Ti alloy and the meta-stable cubic L12 phase forming upon its ball-milling.18,36
The behavior of Al3Ti in alkali metal alanates makes little sense unless one assumes the presence of another phase in the catalytically active material.
Should Al3Ti synergically enhance the activity of this phase, the amount of hydride sufficient for generating the catalytic effect might fall below the detection limits of conventional analytical techniques, so that the careful consideration of indirect evidence would be necessary to fully assess the process.
Fortunately, a long history of aluminohydride-related chemical research and extensive studies into the Al–Ti system have created experimental knowledge that is quite sufficient for developing a credible hypothesis.
Attempts to prepare transition metal aluminohydrides of a general formula M(AlH4)n, where M is a n-valent transition metal, have been made a number of times.1,37
They also included reactions between LiAlH4 and TiCl4 or TiBr4, which produced titanium alanate, Ti(AlH4)4, stable below −80 °C.
Between −80 and 20 °C, the material releases up to 70% of its entire hydrogen content leaving behind titanium hydride (TiH2), titanium and aluminum [eqns.
(16)–(18)].TiX4 + 4LiAlH4 → Ti(AlH4)4 + 4LiX  −110 °CTi(AlH4)4 → TiH2 + 4Al + 7H2  >−80 °CTi(AlH4)4 → Ti + 4Al + 8H2  >−80 °CX = Cl, BrNano-sized titanium hydride inclusions were also found in the Al3Ti alloy treated with gaseous hydrogen.
Although Al3Ti is a very poor hydrogen absorber, it reacts with hydrogen, producing a titanium hydride phase finely distributed in the material.38
A nano-crystalline Al3Ti–TiH2 composite also forms during ball-milling of Al and Ti powders in a hydrogen atmosphere.39
The particle size in such composite is effectively reduced due to the presence of TiH2 and grains in the particles become nano-size with the progression of ball-milling.
A high resolution transmission electron spectroscopy unambiguously confirmed the presence of TiH2 phase at the boundaries of Al3Ti grains.
Authors attribute the formation of Al3Ti–TiH2 to comparable heats of formation of TiH2 and Al3Ti (−144 vs. −146 kJ mol−1).39
Though, due to its higher stability, Al3Ti forms as a principal component.
Surprisingly, possible participation of the titanium hydride species in Ti-promoted transformations of alkali metal aluminohydrides has not been fully explored.
At the same time, the catalytic effect of TiH2 on the decomposition of LiAlH4 and NaAlH4 is well-known.12,19
Furthermore, metallic titanium and titanium micro-powders, which easily form hydride phases in the presence of hydrogen, proved to be active catalysts in hydrogen desorption and absorption by sodium alanate.27,40
Titanium’s ability to split hydrogen molecules into atoms once H2 is absorbed on a Ti-containing surface provides an additional support for the formation of a titanium hydride phase in Al–Ti alloys exposed to hydrogen.41–43
Thus, experimental data collected to date point towards a titanium hydride phase as the most likely reason for catalytic activity of the in situ generated Al3Ti.
However, since titanium forms a broad variety of hydride phases TiHx in the composition range 0 < x < 2,44 it is premature to speculate about its nature until this phase has been fully identified.
The later task may become quite challenging because concentration of meta-stable hydride phases in the sample can fall below detection limit of contemporary analytical techniques or they may decompose while exposed to high-energy irradiation.
In summary, Ti-catalyzed transformations of alkali metal aluminohydrides can be presented as a sequence of chemical processes (Fig. 3), which begin with interactions between Ti-dopant and the host material and produce an Al3Ti alloy containing a catalytic hydride phase.
The catalyst promotes solid state transformations of MAlH4 into MH, Al, and H2; MH formed further reacts with remaining alanate giving rise to M3AlH6, which, in turn, thermally decomposes at an elevated temperature.
Currently, there is no reason to assume that thermal decomposition of alkali metal alanates should depend on the nature of M+.
However, owing to relatively high thermodynamic stability of NaAlH4 and KAlH4 and low reactivity of LiH, decomposition rates and amounts of M3AlH6 formed in decomposing LiAlH4, NaAlH4 and KAlH4 may vary10,13,14,22,24.
Even a brief look at the previous chapters is sufficient to realize the complexity of solid state processes, which take or can take place in alkali metal alanates.
Extensive structural changes and mass transfer, which accompany most of those transformations, are conspicuously restrained in solids.
Therefore, any treatment enhancing freedom of molecular movement in solid hydrogen storage materials should considerably improve their operation.
High-energy ball-milling, where steel or ceramic balls rapidly move in a tightly closed vial, smashing and mixing solids trapped inside, offers a unique opportunity to enhance mass transfer in solid materials without changing their physical state (see also Fig. 2).9,10,19,45–50
While crushing, dispersing, and mixing solids by mechanical milling have been known for millennia, the chemical effect of mechanical processing is hardly explored.
Unfortunately, once again, practical applications in the field of mechanically-induced chemical transformations surpassed theoretical knowledge leaving behind numerous unresolved issues and unanswered questions.
It appears, for instance, that mechanochemical reactions are not exclusively temperature-driven processes as suggested by some researchers.51
Thus, lithium alanate and a temperature sensitive ammonium carbonate, (NH4)2CO3, maintain their integrity even during long-term ball-milling in a Spex mill.23
However, once a catalytic amount of TiCl4 is added to LiAlH4, it quickly decomposes upon ball-milling in the same milling equipment.
Furthermore, it takes only a few hours of milling to prepare Li3AlH6 from LiAlH4 and LiH,23 or to perform a variety of solvent-free chemical reactions otherwise occurring exclusively in solution.45–50
Theoretical analyses of ball-milling in a commercial Spex-type unit revealed a moderate temperature effect of mechanical processing.
At the same time, the pressure generated in the solid, trapped between two colliding balls, can rise to an extremely high level of several GPa52,53 and facilitate genuine ultra-high pressure activated processes.54–56
Unfortunately, a lack of reliable experimental data limits our current understanding of specific chemical effect of mechanical processing.
Therefore, establishing the nature of mechanical activation in molecular and ionic solids requires considerable research effort and is an issue to be resolved in the near future.
In conclusion, analysis of experimental data available to date clearly shows that:
(1) The conventional mechanism of the thermal decomposition of alkali metal aluminohydrides does not satisfactory explain experimental facts acquired by different researchers during the last three decades.
Decomposition of alkali metal aluminohydrides can occur in the solid state as a one-step process without intermediate formation of corresponding hexahydroaluminates.
The presence of the latter in decomposing samples can be attributed to the side-reaction between one of the decomposition products, alkali metal hydride, and the host material, alkali metal alanate.
(2) Experimental data reported in chemical and materials science literature suggests that the catalytic effect of titanium on the thermal decomposition of alkali metal alanates can be attributed to a titanium–hydrogen phase present in the Al3Ti catalyst, which forms upon the reduction of Ti-dopants by alanates during doping process.
(3) Little is known about mechanical activation of chemical transformations in solids.
It is quite clear, however, that besides enhancing the mass transfer, ball-milling has a specific chemical effect, the exact nature of which is to be explored.
Bio-mimicking galactose oxidase and hemocyanin, two dioxygen-processing copper proteins
The modelling of the active sites of metalloproteins is one of the most challenging tasks in bio-inorganic chemistry.
Copper proteins form part of this stimulating field of research as copper enzymes are mainly involved in oxidation bio-reactions.
Thus, the understanding of the structure–function relationship of their active sites will allow the design of effective and environmental friendly oxidation catalysts.
This perspective illustrates some outstanding structural and functional synthetic models of the active site of copper proteins, with special attention given to models of galactose oxidase and hemocyanin.
The study and modeling of the active site of copper-containing proteins is a field of great interest within the scientific community.1
Indeed, proteins containing copper ions at the active site are mainly involved as redox catalysts in a range of biological processes, such as electron transfer, dioxygen transport and oxidation of various bio-substrates (Fig. 1).2,3
Thus, new and very effective bio-inspired homogeneous catalysts for common reactions under mild conditions may be discovered.4 
Copper-containing proteins are widely found in plants, insects, and mammals and have been divided into seven classes according to the structure of their active site,5–7 namely type-1, type-2, type-3, multicopper, CuA, CuB, and CuZ clusters.
The present review primarily deals with the background of the structural and functional modeling of the type-2 and the type-3 active sites of, respectively, galactose oxidase (GOase) and hemocyanin (Hc).
These two metalloproteins have received considerable attention, and some recent outstanding developments have been reported in the literature, updating the future outlook of copper chemistry.8–11
In this perspective, a number of biomimetic coordination compounds are presented together with their potential applications in catalysis, or drug discovery.
Galactose oxidase (GOase) is an enzyme with a type-2 copper site, first isolated in 1959,12 that selectively catalyzes the oxidation of primary alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes and simultaneous reduction of molecular oxygen to hydrogen peroxide.13
The active site of GOase involves a mononuclear copper(ii) species with a distorted square pyramidal geometry.
As the oxidation reaction requires 2 e− and copper is a 1 e− redox metal ion, one of the phenol ligands is most likely involved in the oxidative transformation.
Indeed, in the active form of the bio-catalyst, the equatorial plane is formed by two nitrogen atoms from two histidine imidazoles, one oxygen atom of an ortho-S-modified tyrosyl radical and one oxygen atom of a water molecule.
The axial position is occupied by a second tyrosinate ligand (Fig. 2, species A).
The catalytic mechanism of GOase has been extensively studied (Fig. 2).14
The primary alcohol first coordinates to the active species A, leading to the metal–phenoxyl radical complex B.
This species undergoes proton abstraction from the substrate by the axial tyrosinate, followed by a rapid intramolecular electron transfer from the intermediate ketyl radical anion with reduction of CuII to CuI.
The copper(i) species C reacts with dioxygen to form the hydroperoxo copper(ii) complex D with the release of the aldehyde.
Finally, hydrogen peroxide is released to give back the active form of the enzyme.
Over twenty years, a number of structural models have been reported in the literature15,16, but it appears to be more difficult to model the catalytic activity of GOase17. 
The first effective biomimetic catalysts were described in 1998 by Stack etal. 18 and by Wieghardt et al. 19
Stack et al.18 described a Cu(ii) species, namely [Cu(ii)BSP] where BSP symbolises a salen-type ligand with a binaphthyl backbone and thioether functions (Fig. 3), able to catalyse the oxidation of benzylic and allylic alcohols under dioxygen at room temperature.
The [Cu(ii)BSP] complex has spectroscopic characteristics similar to those of GOase.
0.01 to 0.06% of this copper catalyst can convert neat benzylic and allylic alcohols to their respective aldehydes or ketones in the presence of a basic co-catalyst (Table 1).
Up to 1000 turnovers (TON) were achieved and no further oxidation of the aldehyde products was observed.
The oxidation reactions can also be performed in acetonitrile solutions, although the catalyst is much less efficient in this solvent (Table 1).
Wieghardt et al.19 similarly reported the catalytic oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols by a dinuclear Cu(ii)–phenoxyl complex at 20 °C under air.
The reaction of CuICl with 2,2′-thiobis(2,4-di-tert-butylphenol) and triethylamine (1∶1∶2) in dry methanol under air leads to a mononuclear blue copper complex (Fig. 4).
This coordination compound was synthesized to model the active site of GOase.
Its crystal structure shows a non-expected complex where the sulfur atom of the ligand coordinates to the uncommon tetracoordinated CuII ion (Fig. 5b).
In addition, only one triethylamine is coordinated to the metal center while two were required to mimic the N donors of the histidine residues, and no methanol molecule is present as substrate model (Fig. 5).
Furthermore, a diamagnetic copper compound is formed in THF solution which exhibits spectral features characteristic for coordinated phenoxyl groups (λmax ≈ 404 nm, ε = 8.0 × 103 L mol−1 cm−1; Raman: λexc = 458 nm, ν(C–O˙) = 1451 cm−1).
This complex is most likely dinuclear in solution with two bridging phenolate groups and two phenoxyl ligands as depicted in Fig. 6.
0.2% of the [CuICl(2,2′-thiobis(2,4-di-tert-butylphenol))(NEt3)2] catalyst prepared in-situ at 50 °C in THF was used to oxidise several alcohols at room temperature in air and the most important results are summarized in Table 2.
Thus, ethanol was converted to acetaldehyde with a yield of 63% (TON = 315), but the reaction is not chemoselective.
Indeed, several side-products resulting from C–C coupling were detected (Table 2).
The same results were observed for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol with the formation of 60% (TON = 300) benzaldehyde, small amounts of 1,2-glycol and α-hydroxyketone, and 3–4% of α-diketone (Table 2).
Contrary to GOase, this copper catalyst is also able to oxidise secondary alcohols.
Thus, 2-propanol and diphenylcarbinol can be used as substrates but, in both cases, only the 1,2-diol derivatives resulting from an oxidative C–C coupling are formed with a yield of 61 and 68%, respectively (Table 2).
In contrast, the aerobic oxidation of 2-butanol exclusively leads to the formation of butan-2-one (yield = 39%; TON = 195), suggesting two different reaction pathways for the formation of the carbonyl compounds and for the formation of the 1,2-glycols (Fig. 7).19 
Ethanol, benzyl alcohol or 2-butanol coordinate to the proposed dinuclear copper complex (Fig. 6) to produce the active species I (Fig. 7).
After H abstraction by one of the two phenoxyl groups, a radical is created which is oxidised to the corresponding carbonyl derivative by the second phenoxyl radical.
In the case of 2-propanol and diphenylcarbinol, two alcohol molecules coordinate to the dinuclear moiety resulting in species II (Fig. 7).
The H abstractions by the two phenoxyl ligands generate two secondary radicals which can undergo C–C coupling to give the 1,2-glycol products.
GOase obviously represents an attractive target for the development of bio-inspired approaches aimed at designing selective and environmentally friendly, green oxidation catalysts. 20
The two pioneering bio-mimicking catalysts described above have inspired the scientific community resulting in a number of oxidation Cu-catalysts being reported over the past five years.22
Nevertheless, none of these catalytic systems are able to selectively convert primary alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes like the natural enzyme.13
Recently, some of us developed a catalytic procedure for the selective aerobic oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes based on a CuBr2(Bpy)–TEMPO system (Bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine).21,23
The reactions are carried out under air at room temperature and are catalysed by a [copperII(bipyridine ligand)] complex and 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyl-1-oxy (TEMPO) and base as co-catalysts (Fig. 8).
Several primary benzylic, allylic and aliphatic alcohols have been successfully oxidized with excellent conversions (61–100%) and selectivities as no by-products were detected (Table 3).
These results show that the oxidation of activated alcohols is faster than aliphatic ones, demonstrating that the hydrogen abstraction from the α-carbon atom by TEMPO (Fig. 9b) is most likely the rate-determining step.
No reaction was observed with 1-phenylethanol, an activated secondary benzylic alcohol, or with octan-2-ol which can be associated with the activity of GOase.
Indeed, the proposed active species for this catalytic oxidation can be considered as a model of the active site of GOase (Fig. 9).
The bipyridine N atoms mimic the two histidine ligands, while TEMPO plays the role of both the phenolate and the phenoxyl groups and is most likely involved as a hydrogen acceptor.21 
Competitive experiments were performed in order to confirm this high selectivity towards primary alcohols.
Therefore, mixtures of benzyl alcohol with octan-2-ol or 1-phenylethanol were reacted and no carbonyl products corresponding to the oxidation of the secondary alcohols were observed at all (Table 3).
This lack of reactivity of secondary alcohols may be explained by two factors affecting the catalytic cycle.
(1) Steric effects between the methyl groups of TEMPO and the alcohol can hinder the formation of the active species (Fig. 10a), crucial for the C–H abstraction.
(2) In addition, in the case of primary alcohols, the second β-hydrogen atom can be H-bonded to the oxygen atom of TEMPOH, stabilising the radical intermediate (Fig. 10b).
This bpy/TEMPO-based catalytic system should be regarded as the first synthetic functional model of galactose oxidase as both, the achieved chemoselectivity and the proposed reaction mechanism are close to those of the biological copper enzyme.
Nevertheless, this functional model is not able to compete with the natural enzyme in terms of catalytic efficiency.
Indeed, the rate of turnover is only 0.006 s−1 while it is 800 s−1 for GOase.24
The goal of future research investigations is therefore to improve the proficiency of the catalyst to obtain an economically interesting system for an industrial application.
Hemocyanin (Hc) is a protein with a type-3 copper site, initially studied in the early 70's25 and the crystal structure of its active form was first reported in .199326,27
Hcs are copper-containing respiratory proteins, freely dissolved in the hemolymph of many arthropod and mollusc species.28
This function is related to the capacity of Hc to reversibly bind molecular oxygen at the active site that is a dinuclear copper center.
The protein is thus found in two different forms, i.e. deoxy-Hc, containing a [Cu(i) Cu(i)] pair with a Cu–Cu distance of 4.6 Å, and oxy-Hc.
In the latter form, dioxygen was found to bridge between both copper(ii) ions separated by a distance of 3.6 Å, reflecting an electron transfer process from Cu(i) to dioxygen, where the peroxide dianion is coordinated as a bidentate ligand in a µ-η2:η2 fashion (Fig. 11).
The active site of Hc involves a dinuclear copper species.
In the active form of the biomolecule, the equatorial plane of each CuII ion is formed by two nitrogen atoms from two histidine imidazoles and the two oxygen atoms of a dioxygen molecule.
The axial position is occupied by a third histidine ligand (Fig. 11).
Extensive synthetic efforts have been made to prepare CuII dioxygen complexes using different types of ligands in order to provide a better insight into the binding mode of molecular oxygen in oxyhemocyanin.
In this context, various binding modes of dioxygen have been brought to light and their characteristic spectroscopic features are reported in Table 4.
As early as 1988, Karlin et al. described the first structurally characterized Cu2O2 species using a tripodal N4 ligand, namely tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine (Fig. 12).29
This dioxygen adduct is intensely purple coloured while oxyhemocyanin is intensely blue.
The complex shows strong absorptions at 440, 525, and 590 nm and an additional d–d band at 1035 nm, and Raman vibrations at 832 cm−1 and 561 cm−1.
These spectroscopic data are not characteristic of the µ-η2:η2 dioxygen binding mode observed in oxy-Hc (see Table 4), and have been assigned to peroxo-to-copper charge transfer transitions, and to an intraperoxide O–O stretch and a copper–oxygen stretch, respectively.
The 832 cm−1 stretching vibration clearly indicates the oxidation state of the dioxygen moiety to be O22−.
X-ray data of the thermally and moisture sensitive material were obtained at –90 °C.
It contains an end-on trans µ-1,2 peroxo group (viz. µ-1,2-O22−) bridging the two copper(ii) ions (Fig. 12; Table 4) (Cu⋯Cu = 4.36 Å).
This peroxo compound is only stable below −70 °C.30 
A very important step forward in type-3 copper protein biomimetics was reported in 1989 when Kitajima et al.31 reported a copper–dioxygen complex obtained from an anionic tripodal N3 ligand, i.e. tris(3,5-diisopropylpyrazolyl)borate ligand (Fig. 13).
This deeply purple coloured compound is a stable solid at room temperature or even in non-coordinating solvent (e.g. CHCl3, CH2Cl2) below −10 °C.32
This good stability of the CuII–dioxygen adduct is probably due to the isopropyl groups of the ligand which shield the coordinated molecular oxygen (Fig. 13).
The most remarkable feature observed in its X-ray structure appeared to be the side-on µ-η2:η2-peroxo coordination that holds the two copper units together.
Moreover, the physical properties reported are qualitatively and quantitatively comparable to those of oxy-Hc (See Table 4).
This complex indeed shows UV-Vis absorptions at 349 nm (ε = 21,000) and 551 nm (ε = 800), while for oxyhemocyanin the values are: 340 nm (ε = 20,000) and 580 nm (ε = 1,000).
The low value of the O–O stretch of 741 cm−1 (resonance Raman) also matches the value reported for oxyhemocyanin (744–752 cm−1).
The assumed advantage of using dinucleating ligands to prepare dioxo complexes is their ability to overcome the entropic barrier by keeping two N3 or N4 donor sets close to each other, at a chosen distance defined by the spacer length.
The spacers used to connect two coordinating units can be alkyl chains,33 phenoxo bridges,34 xylyl bridges35 or cyclohexyl bridges.36
Thus, Karlin et al. prepared a dinucleating ligand by linking two mononucleating tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine (TPA) ligands through an ethylene bridge.37,38
A similar trans µ-1,2-peroxo-dicopper(ii) species could be obtained with this ligand (Figs. 12 and 14), which shows the characteristic UV-Vis absorptions (420 nm, 540 nm, and 600 nm) and Raman resonance (O–O stretch at 830 cm−1) for this type of dioxygen binding mode (Table 4).
However, this bis-TPA peroxo complex has a half-life time of 20 s at room temperature, while the TPA-peroxo species is only stable below −70 °C.
This significant enhancement of the stability clearly reflects the benefit achieved through the bridging of two TPA moieties.39 
Very recently, Kodera et al. 40 took advantage of all the research investigations performed in this field to synthesize a ligand featuring almost every beneficial characteristic which are: (1) a N3 donor set in order to obtain the biomimetic side-on µ-η2:η2 dioxygen binding mode of oxy-Hc; (2) a bridge between two monucleating units to increase the stability of the peroxo complex prepared; (3) and sterically hindered alkyl groups close to the N donor atoms to further enhance the stability of the µ-1,2-O22−-dicopper(ii) adduct.
Thus, Kodera et al. prepared the ligand 1,2-bis[2-(bis(6-methyl-2-pyridyl)methyl)-6-pyridyl]ethane which possesses all these essential features.
Indeed, a µ-η2:η2 peroxo complex could be synthesized from this ligand which was found stable, at room temperature, for 3.6 h in dichloromethane solution.40
As expected, the peroxo complex exhibits the typical spectroscopic data of the binding mode encountered in oxy-Hc (Table 4) that are UV-Vis absorption bands at 366 nm and 537 nm, and a Raman O–O stretch at 765 cm−1. 
In addition, the dioxygen binding is reversible which confers to this biomimetic compound, the status of best synthetic model of hemocyanin reported so far.
One step further than dinucleating ligands is the macrocyclic system.
The believed benefit of using macrocyclic ligands in coordination chemistry is the high predictability of their metal complexes.
In principle, macrocyclic ligands can be designed to hold the proper donor groups in a preorganized rigid three-dimensional environment.41,42
Therefore, the macrocyclic ligand usually has a lower degree of conformational freedom in solution which may prevent the formation of unexpected or unwanted compounds upon coordination to the metallic centres.
Furthermore, highly reactive copper-peroxo species trapped in a macrocycle, might be stabilised.
Recently, the use of the macrocyclic ligand MePy22Pz (Fig. 15) by some of us also produced a room-temperature stable Cu2O2 species.43
Single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction could not be obtained, but the spectroscopic data (viz. UV-Vis and resonance Raman) are comparable to those observed by Karlin (Section 3.2.1).
Thus, a trans-µ-1,2-peroxo-dicopper(ii) structure has been assigned, which is room temperature stable for 0.5 h in dichloromethane and air-stable for months in the solid-state (Fig. 16)44. 
Synthetic models of tyrosinase45 or catechol oxidase46 have found many applications in catalysis.47
An important and rising field of application is the design of copper-based anti-cancer drugs.48
This perspective will highlight just a few of these last ones.
One way to eradicate cancer cells is to cleave their DNA,49 like the cleavage of the DNA strands through the oxidation of the sugar moieties (Fig. 17).50 
This type of cytotoxic activity is shown by some copper complexes which act as synthetic chemical nucleases.51
One goal in the field of anti-cancer drug discovery is to synthesize metal complexes able to cleave both strands of a DNA molecule.
Indeed, a single-strand break (SSB, Fig. 18a) leads to damaged DNA which can often be easily repaired by the cellular enzymatic machinery.
On the other hand, if both DNA strands are broken (DSB, Fig. 18b), the restoration of the initial double-stranded supramolecule becomes almost impossible, the two DNA pieces being far apart.
Consequently, a drug able to perform DSBs will be very effective, as are the known natural bleomycin52 and neocarzinostatin.53 
The relaxation of supercoiled circular DNA (form I) into relaxed (form II) and linear (form III) forms is commonly used to quantify the relative cleavage efficiencies of different complexes (Fig. 19).
A single-strand break (SSB) leads to form II while more than one SSB result in form III which is practically not repairable for the cellular enzymes.
A very effective cytotoxic drug would be a synthetic nuclease capable of performing a direct DSB (Figs. 18b and 19).
Indeed, more the one SSB on the same DNA molecule is statistically barely probable.
Recently, Karlin et al. 54–56 tested the peroxo complexes described in Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 (See Figs. 12 and 14), as DNA cleaving agents.
The results are depicted in Fig. 20.
Both coordination compounds are active, but the mononuclear complex obtained from the tripodal ligand tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine (TPA) is not effective in linearizing supercoiled DNA, as only the circular form II is detected on the agarose gel (Fig. 20a).54
In contrast, the dinuclear copper complex obtained from the ethylene-bridged TPA ligand (see Fig. 14) is capable of mediating the conversion of supercoiled DNA (Form I) to its linear form III (Fig. 20b).54
The results suggest that the dinuclear complex is able to perform more than one SSB (possibly a DSB) on the same DNA molecule while the mononuclear complex obviously cannot (See Fig. 19).
In addition, this significant difference in activity is consistent with their relative abilities to activate molecular oxygen (See Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2)54. 
The study and modeling of the active site of dioxygen-processing copper proteins such as galactose oxidase or hemocyanin was started some fifteen years ago with the pioneering work of Karlin29 and Kitajima.31
However, the first outstanding applications ensuing from these research investigations have only been reported some ten years later, in 1998.
Nevertheless, over the past six years, an increasing amount of applied synthetic models of the type-257 and type-358 active site of copper proteins have been described in the literature almost weekly.
Thus, a considerable development can be expected in the coming years in this still incipient field, demonstrating the importance of bio-mimicking nature.
Copper oxidation chemistry is assured a great future.
Analysis of an algebraic model for the chromophore vibrations of CF3CHFI
We extract the dynamics implicit in an algebraic fitted model Hamiltonian for the hydrogen chromophore’s vibrational motion in the molecule CF3CHFI.
The original model has four degrees of freedom, a conserved polyad allows the reduction to three degrees of freedom.
For most quantum states we can identify the underlying motion that when quantized gives the said state.
Most of the classifications, identifications and assignments are done by visual inspection of the already available wave function semiclassically transformed from the number representation to a representation on the reduced dimension toroidal configuration space corresponding to the classical action and angle variables.
The concentration of the wave function density to lower dimensional subsets centered on idealized simple lower dimensional organizing structures and the behavior of the phase along such organizing centers already reveals the atomic motion.
Extremely little computational work is needed.
In recent years we have developed methods to investigate algebraic models (spectroscopic Hamiltonians) for the vibrations of molecules.1–5
The Hamiltonians reproduce and encode by their construction the experimental data.6–12
In the mentioned examples the system is reducible to two degrees of freedom.
As the next logical step we have turned to systems where after all possible reductions three degrees of freedom remain.
A first example of this kind has been treated in ref. 13, in the present paper we treat as further example the molecule CF3CHFI for which in ref. 14 an algebraic model has been presented for the motion of the H atom (chromophore).
This model has four degrees of freedom and it has one conserved polyad which can be used to reduce it to three degrees of freedom.
From known wave functions represented in the toroidal configuration space of action/angle variables15 we show that we can visually sort most of the states into ladders of states with similar topology.
Each ladder has a relatively simple spectrum.
Complexity arises from their interleaving.
We also can recognize underlying classical lower dimensional organizing structures by the fact that for these inherently complex functions the eigenstate density (magnitude squared) is concentrated around them and the phase has simple behavior near them.
The position of these structures in angle space reveals the nature of the resonance interaction causing the topology.
It also allows the reconstruction of the motion of the atoms which underlie this particular quantum state.
By counting nodes in plots of the density and of the phase advances in corresponding plots of the phase quantum excitation numbers can be obtained.
In many cases, along with the polyad quantum number itself, we thereby obtain a complete set of quantum numbers for a state even though the corresponding classical motion is nonintegrable.
These classification numbers can be interpreted as quasi-conserved quantities for this particular state or for the ladder of states based on the same dynamic organizational element.
Since the Hamiltonian used here has the same functional structure as the one used in ref. 13 and since also the methods of investigation are the same, we mainly present results for the present molecule and refer to ref. 13 for the detailed explanations of the method.
For the description of the chromophore dynamics of the molecule CF3CHFI we use the model set up in .ref. 14
It is based on four degrees of freedom as required by the nature of the observed overtone spectroscopy.
The index s stands for the stretch of the H atom, the index a labels its bend in the HCCF(4) plane, the index b labels its bend perpendicular to this plane, and the index f stands for the transpositioned C–F stretch.
For the exact atomic motion belonging to these four degrees of freedom see Fig. 2 in .ref. 14
The algebraic Hamiltonian fitted to experiment and to calculations on a fitted potential surface has a natural decompositioninto a diagonal part(here the indices j and m run over the four degrees of freedom a, b, f, s) and an interaction partwhere aj and aj† are the usual harmonic destruction and creation operators of degree of freedom j.
In eqn. (3) the indices j and m run over the three degrees of freedom a, b, f.
For the coefficients we use the ones given in column 6 in Table 1 in ref. 14 where we see that roughly ωs ≈ 2ωa ≈ 2ωb ≈ 2ωf giving rise to the Fermi resonances anticipated by the terms of eqn. (3) and the Darling–Dennison resonances anticipated by the terms of Eqs.
(4–6).
This Hamiltonian has as a conserved quantity, the polyad P, defined aswith the corresponding operator given as P̂ by replacing nj → a†jaj.
One can now study each polyad separately.
The expansion of the eigenfunctions Ψj into number statesis gotten from the diagonalization of the H-matrix in number state basis.
To construct the corresponding classical Hamiltonian in action/angle variables I/ϕ we use the substitution rules ,after bringing all operators into symmetrical order, then the classical action Ij corresponds to nj + 1/2.
Semiclassically we represent a number state (basis state in our case) as a periodic plane wave on the configuration torus of the coordinates ϕj:Then from eqn. (8) we get That is, the expansion of the eigenstate into number states from eqn. (8) is converted into a Fourier decomposition on the torus.
Dimension reduction can now be carried out by noting that, using the polyad of eqn. (7) to eliminate the fast degree of freedom s, the jth eigenstate can be written By the last equation the reduced wave function χjP is defined.
This shows that the eigenfunctions in a given polyad P have a common phase factor dependence on ϕs and really only depend on the reduced wave function χjP which is a function of the three anglesor j = a,b,f.
These three angles make up a three dimensional toroidal configuration space T3 upon which χkP is situated.
The angle transformation of eqn. (14) plus the trivial transformationcan be supplemented to give a canonical transformation by introducing the new actions again for j = a,b,f and θ is a cyclic angle, therefore the conjugate action K can be treated as parameter and the system is reduced to one with three degrees of freedom.
The atomic motion belonging to a trajectory in reduced phase space is gotten as follows.
First we integrate the Hamilton equations for  the cyclic angle; second we undo the canonical transformation for all variables.
And third we assume a harmonic model for the transition from action/angle variable to position variables in each degree of freedom.
We call this reconstruction the “lift” (for details see ref. 13).
The wave functions are manifestly complex function and in the following we use their representation by absolute value and phase as Their inspection is key to our analysis.
Their magnitudes (or densities) and phases are both plotted in the cube whose sides are associated with the ψj on the 0 to 2π range.
Periodic boundary conditions are used so as to associate properly with the 3D configuration torus.
Symmetry properties of the system will show up in the following.
The Hamiltonian is invariant under a simultaneous shift of all angles ψj by π.
Therefore the reduced configuration torus T3 covers the original configuration space twice and all structures show up in double, even though they really exist only once.
In addition the system is invariant under a shift of any angle ψj by 2π and it is invariant under a reflection where all angles go over into their negatives.
The basis functions have constant density and therefore any eigenstate dominated by a single basis function has a density without sharp localization.
Resonances as for example 2ωa ≈ ωs will be seen to cause localization about a line ψa = constant.
This follows as ψa = ϕa − ϕs/2 = constant when differentiated with respect to time gives the frequency relation.
Hence it is seen that resonances are associated with localization and the fact that dψj/dt = 0.
It can be claimed that by using angle coordinates that slow to zero velocity at resonance we here assure that the wave function will “collapse” onto and about a lower dimensional subspace called the organization center.
This in reverse gives a way to recognize the influence of resonances, namely localization of the wave function on the configuration torus.
Each linearly independent locking of angles therefore reduces by 1 the dimension of the subset of configuration space around which the wave function is concentrated.
The nodal structures will be visible and countable in directions perpendicular to the organization element and clearly will be associated with a localized direction.
The count of such transversal nodes supplies for each direction of localization a transverse quantum number t, that replaces an original mode quantum number n which has been destroyed by the resonant interaction.
The wave function in all the localized directions can be considered as qualitatively similar (a continuous deformation) of an oscillator state of the corresponding dimension.
The transverse quantum numbers tk are the corresponding oscillator excitation numbers.
The phase functions Φ according to eqn. (18) are smooth and close to a plane wave in subsets parallel to the organization center (usually they are subsets of high density) and have jumps by π and singularities in other parts of the configuration space.
Therefore phase advances along fundamental cycles inside such distinguished subsets are well defined and are necessarily integer multiples of 2π.
They provide longitudinal quantum numbers lk which also replace the interacting mode quantum numbers.
The configuration space is a three-dimensional torus which we can represent as a cube with identified opposite boundary points.
Three dimensional (perspective) plots of the semiclassical state functions look too often like large globes of ink and were not informative.
Here we will resort to cuts of the cube (e.g. cut ψa = ψb) and plot density and phase in such cuts.
The appropriate choice of the cuts is found partially by trial and error and partially by the following considerations: In CF3CHFI a resonance with a rather close frequency is ωf ≈ ωb and its associated kb,f in the Hamiltonian is largest.
This suggests that modes b and f should be coupled in planes ψf = ψb + constant which assures ωfeff = ωbeff.
The simultaneous Fermi coupling conditions ωs = 2ωa and ωs = 2ωf give by similar reasoning the organizing line ψa = c1, ψf = c2.
For some states several organizing structures could be used and the same dynamics revealed.
Our experience is to choose those corresponding resonances which seem more important in H and which give longer ladders of states.
Starting at the bottom of the polyad we find 64 states that definitely lie in the Darling–Dennison ωf = ωb resonance class in that they have densities localized about planes all denotable as ψf = ψb + constant.
They also have simple phase plots in these planes.
At the lower end a few of them could also be organized by the ωs = 2ωf, ωs = 2ωb Fermi resonances, i.e. about a line in the “a” direction.
But they occur when the stretch excitation is zero and this classification is not very physical.
Some of the lowest states could also be assigned for all modes by quantum numbers nj and correspond to continuous deformations of basis functions.
Although these nj are useful in the lift for obtaining actions these assignment misses the phase and frequency locking and the localization of the density.
In addition we looked very carefully for primary tori in the classical phase space at the corresponding energy and did not find any.
Therefore Einstein–Brillouin–Keller (EBK) quantization cannot be applied.
Hence classical dynamics shows that the assignment by nj for j = a,b,f is unphysical.
For the organization center ψf = ψb + constant. the modes “a” and “s” are uncoupled and the Darling–Dennison resonance couples “f” and “b” such that mode “b”, a true mode of the hydrogen atom motion, is driven by the generic source mode f which represents the effect of the motion of the rest of the molecule on the hydrogen atom motion.
The organization plane has the topological structure of a two dimensional torus.
Therefore it has two fundamental loops which are used for phase counts to get two longitudinal quantum numbers.
One of these loops runs into the “a” direction and provides the excitation number la = na.
The other fundamental loop of the organization plane corresponds to the combination of a loop in the “b” direction with a loop in the “f” direction.
Accordingly a phase count along this loop gives a number lb+f representing the excitation of the coupled b/f motion.
Then the polyad number implies the value of ns as ns = P − na/2 − lb+f/2.
Finally we need a transverse quantum number representing the degree of excitation perpendicular to the plane ψf = ψb + constant.
What at first was confusing was that perpendicular structures appeared to be organized about one of two parallel planes at low energy and at higher energy about third and fourth planes lying in between.
At low energy this observation and the fact that pairs of states with identical (ns,na,lf+b,t) assignments appeared, led to the discovery of a dynamic nearly symmetric double well or double “valley”.
Two organizing planes at ψf = ψb and ψf = ψb + π, each run along one of the valleys.
The ψf = ψb valley is slightly deeper making the ψb → ψb + π invariance only approximate.
This asymmetric “double well” becomes also evident from an “accessibility diagram”.
This is a plot of regions of configuration space, i.e. the values of ψa, ψb and ψf that satisfy E = H(Ja, Jb, Jf, ψa, ψb, ψf; P), at each E, for given P and any compatible actions.
Around 11100 cm−1 (well below the lowest quantum state of polyad 5 and near to the classical lower end of polyad 5) it was noted that only two slabs of configuration space were accessible; these are our wells.
At the energy of the lowest quantum state all configuration space is accessible but the wells act as two attractive regions that cause quantum localization above them.
For some of the lower states, the energy in the “mode f–mode b” lock is low enough that these states are primarily localized in the ψf = ψb or the ψf = ψb + π well.
As energy increases the states are roughly speaking “above the barrier” of the “double well” with density on both sides and they fall into near symmetric (+) and antisymmetric (−) pairs (with the same ns,na,la+b,t) reflecting the approximate invariance ψb → ψb + π.
Each member of these pairs has a slight density preference for one of the wells.
The ladders with an even la start with a + state and ladders with an odd la start with a − state.
The lowest state in any ladder of constant la always has most of its density near the plane ψf = ψb.
In Table 1 this (±) classification label appears.
In Table 1 we give the transverse quantum number as seen from the planes ψb = ψf and ψf = ψbπ as t.
For higher states it sometimes becomes difficult to count t.
The reason for this can be traced to the fact that a slice transverse to the organizing plane should ideally reveal wave functions that represent oscillators.
The density would then be the highest in two planes running parallel and on opposite sides of the organizing plane.
Now consider that for higher states the density is localized about both planes (albeit with a preference for one plane).
As excitation increases then the outer lobes of the transverse oscillator will move toward the planes in between (recall all features appear by symmetry in doubles) the two original planes i.e. the planes ψf = ψb ± π/2 on which the highest density will now accumulate.
Hence it now make sense to count transverse nodes between these now bigger intensities.
The corresponding transverse quantum number is called t′.
As always the transverse quantum number indicates to which extent the coupled motion goes out of exact phase lock.
It is a measure of the width of the phase distribution.
A feature that further complicates and hides the true interpretation of the states is mixing due to the accidental degeneracies of two or three states.
The mixed final eigenstates that result are spotted by noting their near degenerate energies and their lack of almost all of the above discussed features.
Trial and error demixing using various weights yields states with the above features.
The notation s/s′ or s/s″/s″ indicates in Table 1 that this particular state is a demixing of s + s′ etc.
The dynamical importance of the ψb = ψf + c planes is further confirmed by running many long classical trajectories that show that the motion, i.e. the flow of the trajectories, is mainly parallel to the ψf = ψb plane and in addition is mainly in the direction of the space diagonal i.e. guided by the condition ψf = ψb = ψa.
This is not totally unexpected as ωa ≈ ωb ≈ ωf.
This effect is reflected in the observation that in the organizing planes ψf = ψb and ψf = ψb + π the wave functions tend to have fibers of density running along the diagonal.
In fact a diagonal classification could have served many states as the organizing structure and assignment might have been made relative to it.
We chose the planes as the organizing structures as breaks in this diagonal fibration often made assignment less than clear.
To illustrate our ideas let us consider two states, state s = 7 and s = 43 at the bottom and the middle of the ladder respectively.
Both states are organized about ψf = ψb giving a DD ωf = ωb expectation.
State 7 is a low state with its density running up the valley in the middle of the well as seen in Fig. 1c and 1a.
Recall again that due to the symmetry property mentioned in the section 3 all features come in double.
Fig. 1a looks down on the organizing plane and Fig. 1c looks sideways.
In Fig. 2 the higher excited case is exhibited.
The highest density is in the plane ψf = ψb + π/8.
Fig. 2a and 2b look down on this plane of high density and Fig. 2c and 2d show a view from the side that shows transverse excitation.
From the phase plots we see the quantum numbers na = 2 for state 7 (Fig. 1b) and na = 1 for state 43 (Fig. 2b) and lb+f = 8 for state 7 and lb+f = 7 for state 43.
Using the polyad number P = 5 this implies ns = P − (na + lb+f)/2 = 0 for state 7 and ns = 1 for state 43.
Note: For state 43 phase simplicity only happens in the organizing plane.
Fig. 2d shows no useful phase information.
The plot shows jumps along lines and ramp singularities where the phase value depends on the direction of approach.
The transverse structure of the states becomes evident in density plots in some appropriate plane transverse to the plane of high density.
In Fig. 1c we see that state 7 has t = 0 and in Fig. 2c we see that state 43 has t = 1.
The number t′ does not make sense for state 7 and the number t′ = 2 for state 43 is rather unclear from Fig. 2c.
However the phase plot in Fig. 2d shows two lines of phase jumps near the lines ψa = ψb ± π/2 and these lines of phase jumps indicate nodal lines of the density.
Since this is a somewhat indirect indication of the value t′ = 2, in Table 1 the number t′ = 2 for state 43 is set in brackets.
At this point 64 states for P = 5 can be assigned clearly by the same scheme.
An additional 38 states seem to resemble this picture.
The resemblance is only seen as trends from the systematic following of the 64 other ones.
For these, increasing but still smaller effects of many other resonances are taking their toll and they significantly degrade the assignable states into unassignable more heavily mixed quantum analogues of classical chaos.
The Table 1 indicates which states have less certain assignments.
By comparing the phase function at the ψf = ψb (plane 1) and ψf = ψb + π (plane 2) wells for each pair of states with the same quantum numbers the (+) and (−) assignment can be made.
Even at this stage where other ladders discussed below are omitted spectral complexity arises from the interlacing of energy levels of different subladders.
The roughly 100 states on the ladder which only demands the DD-f/b lock for its construction gives a complex spectrum and nontransparent energy spacings.
In addition the individual ladders appear irregular by the mixing of states.
A sequence of states which are pure excitations of a single organization element would form a regular ladder of energy levels looking like the spectrum of one anharmonic oscillator.
However by the mixing the eigenstates are mixtures of various pure excitations and thereby their energies are shifted and thereby the ladders appear more irregular.
The reader will note that some ladder states in Table 1 are missing.
These states could not be found but their disappearance is confirmed using the anharmonic models expected energy spacing.
Formally these states lie among the highly mixed (chaotic?) states we discuss below.
They are mixings of more than two dynamically identifiable states and do not show the near degeneracy that our demixing process identifies.
If we go back to displacements qj corresponding to the original degrees of freedom, then we find the following for the motion of the H atom in states based on the above described organization element: In projections into the (qs, qa/b/f) planes a roughly rectangular region is seen whose sides are proportional to and .
The hydrogen trajectories motion interior to the rectangle will be quasiperiodic motion.
The exact trajectory depends on the initial choices of ϕs and ϕa/b/f and is really not important.
In the (qa, qb) plane we find ellipses whose relative ranges (excursion from zero displacement) in the (qa, qb) variables are .
The ellipses eccentricity depends on the organizing structures phase shift, viz.ψa = ψb + δ → ϕa = ϕb + δ.
δ = 0 and π give zero angular momentum and something approaching a straight line motion while δ = ±π/2 gives maximal angular momentum and elliptical motion which becomes circular if na = nb.
The t value is the out of phase motion and causes fluctuations of the eccentricity.
At the upper end of the polyad we take to start states 160 and 161.
A cut in ψb = 0 (or any other value of ψb) reveals as we see in Fig. 3 for state 160 what looks like two columns of density localized around ψa = π and ψf = π.
In comparison state 161 (not shown) only has one column.
A cut in the plane ψb = constant is called to see that the columns really exist.
Fig. 3 shows that they do for state 160 and it also holds for state 161.
Clearly for both these states the line ψa = π, ψf = π is the organizing structure.
Since it loops in ψb, mode b is decoupled and the phase picture for both states shows (Fig. 3 for state 160, state 161 not shown) that as ψb → ψb + 2π along the organizing line no wave fronts are crossed and hence there is no phase advance.
Hence lb = nb = 0.
For the upper end of the polyad also classical dynamics shows a flow in b direction.
As always the figures show all structures in two copies which in reality are only one structure.
Now the ψa = ψf = π organizing structure implies that the phase locks are ϕa = ϕs/2 and ϕf = ϕs/2.
Time differentiation of these relations show that the frequency locks are of 2:1 Fermi type with the stretch mode locking with the bend mode a and the mode f.
Clearly for the organizing structure ψa = ψf then ϕa = ϕf is a valid phase lock and ωa = ωf is a DD 1 ∶ 1 frequency lock.
Since all three types of terms appear in the Hamiltonian we can be assured that all three frequencies are in lock and that the quantum numbers na, nf and ns no longer exist.
They must be replaced by three quantum numbers of the lock one of which can be P and the other two can be taken as the number of nodes seen in the ψa = 0 cut along the antidiagonal as t1 = 1 and along the diagonal as t2 = 0.
For state 161 since one column exists t1 = t2 = 0.
If energy decreases from the top, then the classical flow turns into the space diagonal direction rather soon and accordingly only the four highest quantum states show (partly after demixing) a clean fiber structure in b direction.
The fiber is always sharp in the a direction but broad in the f direction.
This demonstrates again an emerging b–f mixing in the system.
The next seven states still show some tendency towards fibers in b direction (they are no longer really clean), but at the same time also show the beginning of fibers in the diagonal direction.
Their assignment as states organized along b fibers is less clear but still they continue the trends seen in the four highest states (partly after demixing).
The corresponding assignments for the 11 highest states are compiled in Table 2.
An idea of the internal motion of the deuterium and the CF stretch can be obtained from the actions, phase relations and the t1 and t2 values.
In all (qi,qj) planes the actions again define the maximal displacement of each qj from its equilibrium.
Clearly this range is meant in the sense that an average is made over the values of the two variables not represented in the plane.
The plane (qb, qj), j = a,f,s will show rectangularly bound quasiperiodic motion.
In the (qs, qa/f) plane a U shaped region is swept out.
Here qa/f reaches its extreme values as qs reaches its maximum displacement and qs sweeps its range twice for each sweep of qa/f.
Increasing t1 and/or t2 causes the lifted trajectory to oscillate in a tube about this basic U lift.
Of course qf and qa reach their maxima (minima) in phase as the three modes s, a and f are phase locked.
In the middle of the polyad there are approximately 35 states with very complicated wave functions which we could not classify in any scheme.
It is possible that further and closer analysis could reveal some systematics.
These states are dispersed among the states mentioned in subsection 4.1.
But interestingly a few simple states which do not fall into any scheme discussed so far are also dispersed in this region.
In this subsection we present a few of them.
Fig. 4 shows the structure of state 82, parts a and b give density and phase respectively in the plane ψf = 0 and parts c ans d show the plane ψb = ψa + 0.29 * 2π.
Part a demonstrates some concentration around ψa = ±π/2 and at the same time around ψa = ψb ±π/2 with a transverse excitation t = 1.
Plots of the phases in various planes show that planes ψa = ψb + constant are the only planes with a simple phase structure.
Fig. 4d shows it in the plane of highest density.
The phase function comes very close to a plane wave with la+b = 8 and lf = 2.
Together with the above mentioned transverse quantum number t = 1 this gives the complete assignment of the state.
In Fig. 4 notice that also the interaction between the degrees of freedom f and s has an effect, it concentrates the density mainly around ψf = 0 and ψf = π.
There are a few other examples (states 93, 111, 114, 122 and 136) which show such a clean phase function in planes ψb = ψa ±π/2 but do not show a clean phase function in any other plane.
There are approximately 5 other states where the phase function is not as clean as in Fig. 4d but comes close to a continuous deformation of a plane wave only in a plane of this type.
The motion of all these states is a circular motion of the H atom, two orthogonal bends with relative phase shift locked at ±π/2.
Numerical results for state 80 are shown in Fig. 5, part a and b show density and phase respectively in the plane ψb = ψa ± ψf + π/2 which is the plane of high density and thereby the organizing structure.
Part c and d show density and phase respectively in the transverse plane ψf = 0.
In the plane of high density the phase function comes close to a plane wave with la+b = 6 and lf+b = 5.
This is the only plane where the phase function is a continuous deformation of a plane wave.
This case is something new in so far as there is a plane with a simple phase function and at the same time not a single nj has a definite value.
There is a locking involving all modes without implying a locking in any pair of modes.
A few other states (75,83,87,118) fall into the same scheme, i.e. they have simple phase functions only in a plane of the form ψb = ψa + ψf + constant.
The implications for the motion of the atoms are as follows.
In the nonreduced variables the locking condition is ϕb + ϕs/2 − ϕa − ϕf = ±π/2.
This can be interpreted as a locking of the beat frequency between a pair of degrees of freedom to the beat frequency of the remaining pair of degrees of freedom.
We have two possibilities to group the four modes into appropriate pairs.
We have shown how our previously developed methods can also be applied to systems with three degrees of freedom after reduction.
For 75 percent of the states the strategy works successfully.
We investigate the wave functions constructed on a toroidal configuration space.
We investigate on which subsets the density is concentrated and evaluate the phase function on this subset of high density and in addition the nodal structure perpendicular to it.
This allows us to obtain a set of excitation numbers and a complete assignment of the state.
The excitation numbers can be interpreted as quasi-conserved quantities for this particular state.
The success of the method is based on three properties of our strategy which more traditional approaches starting from potential surfaces do not have.
First, we start from an algebraic Hamiltonian which naturally decomposes into an unperturbed H0 and a perturbation W.
Perturbation theory assures us that W contains only the dominant interactions, leaving out those that do not affect the qualitative organization of the states.
In addition having the ideal H0 results in the classical Hamiltonian being formulated from the start in action and angle variables belonging to H0.
For a potential surface it is very complicated to construct an appropriate H0 and the corresponding action/angle variables.
Our knowledge of the correct H0 allows the continuous deformation connection of some eigenstates of H with the corresponding eigenstates of H0 which was useful for many states.
Second in the algebraic Hamiltonian the polyad (which for the real molecule is only an approximate conserved quantity) is an exactly conserved quantity and allows the reduction of the number of degrees of freedom.
We always deal with one degree of freedom less than the number of degrees of freedom on the potential surface.
Third, our strategy depends to a large extent on having a compact configuration space with nontrivial homology where the phase of the wave function is important and where the phase advances divided by 2π along the fundamental cycles of the configuration space provide a large part of the excitation numbers.
In part also feature one is responsible for the importance of the phases.
This is an essential difference to working in usual position space.
In total we have found a semiclassical representation of the states which is actually much simpler to view than the usual position space one.
We emphasize that no calculation is required to produce these states since theare gotten from eqn. (8).
As discussed in ref. 13, when localization occurs it is often possible to lift the organizing structure back to molecular space in a qualitative manner and hence avoiding even the need to compute any trajectories.
Qualitative pictures of the motion upon which the states are quantized are then available.
The classical dynamics of the system shows rather little regular motion and is strongly unstable.
Then the question arises in which way the quantum states reflect anything from the classical chaos.
We propose the following answer: In the middle of the polyad a large number of states do not show any simple organization pattern.
For some of those states it might be that we simply have not found the right representation in which to see the organizational center.
However we doubt that this is the case for many states.
For many of the complicated states the wave function is really without a simple structure, it seems to be a complicated interference between several organizational structures.
Then immediately comes the idea to mix these states with their neighboring states to extract simple structures in the way as we did it for example for states 22 and 24.
For most of the complicated states this method does not lead to any success.
This indicates that underlying simple patterns are distributed over many states so that demixing becomes rather hopeless and maybe also meaningless.
In the spirit of reference16 this indicates that the density of states is already so high that many states fall into the energy interval over which states are considered almost degenerate and mix strongly.
This is a strong difference to the systems which could be reduced to two degrees of freedom.
There the density of states was much lower such that mixing only occurred occasionally between two neighboring states.
This stronger mixing gives some clue as to how the quantum wave functions become complicated for classically chaotic systems and for sufficiently high quantum excitation.
Finally there may come up the question why we do not use some of the common statistical procedures (like random matrix theory) to treat our system when effects of classical chaos become evident in a quantum system.
The answer is: We are not satisfied with only generic (universal) properties of the system or with the investigation to which extent such universal properties are realized by our system.
We aim to investigate each individual quantum state one after the other and to work out its individual properties in order to arrive in the best case at a complete set of quantum numbers and in addition at a detailed description of the atomic motion underlying the individual state.
Previous examples have shown that our procedure provides a complete classification for simpler systems which can be reduced to two degrees of freedom.
As the example presented in this paper shows, this program is doable with good success for a large number of states even in a system with originally four degrees of freedom, reducible only to three degrees of freedom and with a complicated classical dynamics.
Metalloglycomics: a new perspective upon competitive metal–carbohydrate binding using EPR spectroscopy
Ternary complexes formed between calcium, the oxochromium(v) ion and N-acetylneuraminic (sialic) acid (naH6) of the form, Ca(ii)–oxoCr(v)–naH6, have electronic structures and equilibrium distributions distinct from the binary oxoCr(v)–naH6 analogues, as illustrated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy.
Sialic acids are a family of carbohydrates ubiquitous throughout the animal kingdom that are structurally defined as 9-membered carbon chains with an α-keto acid head group.1
The most abundant sialic acid in humans is N-acetylneuraminic acid (naH6; Scheme 1) which occurs predominantly as the terminal residue of protein- and lipid-based cell-surface glycoconjugates.1
Structural features of naH6 include a tert-2-hydroxycarboxylate ‘head’ group, which is deprotonated at physiological pH (pKa ∼ 2.6), and a glycerol ‘tail’.
The 2′-OH α-glycoside link from naH6 to the penultimate glycoconjugate residue orients the glycerol tail towards the extracellular milieu inviting interactions with biometals.
The interaction between Ca(ii) and naH6 has been investigated previously;2 the structure of a binary (1 : 1) complex determined from 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy (Scheme 1) proposes Ca(ii) binds to naH6 (as the free acid, where β : α ∼ 92 : 8) via the carboxylate O1, OR, O7 and O8 groups.3
More recently, both the tert-2-hydroxycarboxylate ‘head’ group of naH6 (O1,O2) in addition to the glycerol ‘tail’ (O7,O8,O9) have been established as viable chelates of select transition metal ions using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy,4 NMR spectroscopy,5 or potentiometry;6 EPR spectroscopy in particular continues to emerge as a powerful tool in studying metal–bioligand speciation.4,7
Strong EPR signals from solutions of Cr(vi) and glutathione (GSH) in the presence of excess naH6 (Fig. 1; black) are attributed to a distribution of five-coordinate oxoCr(v)–naH6 complexes (d1) in which two naH6 units chelate the oxoCr(v) ion ([naH6] > [oxoCr(v)]) via combinations of the O1,O2, O7,O8 or O8,O9 groups.4
The multiplicity of the central xCr (x = 50, 52, 54; I = 0) signal (Fig. 1; RHS) conveys the number (n) of protons (I = ½; 2nI + 1) in the second coordination sphere that perturb the Cr(v) redox (dxy) orbital (e.g.; n = 0, bis-O1,O2 singlet; n = 4, bis-O7,O8 quintet; n = 6, bis-O8,O9 septet).4
There is a pH dependence of the distribution of oxoCr(v)–naH6 species whereby isomers of the O1,O2-coordinated species (giso = 1.9785; 1.9792) dominate under acidic conditions (Fig. 1a) and the series of O7,O8- and O8,O9-coordinated species (giso ∼ 1.9800) dominate at alkaline pH values (Fig. 1c, d).4
This work shows that in the presence of excess Ca(ii) ([Ca(ii)] : [naH6] = 10) there is significant modulation to the Cr(v) EPR signals (Fig. 1; purple) which suggests the formation of ternary Ca(ii)–oxoCr(v)–naH6 complexes that have electronic structures (as indicated by variations in giso values and 1H aiso values) distinct from the binary oxoCr(v)–naH6 analogues. Also, the pH-dependent equilibrium distribution of oxoCr(v)–naH6 species clearly differs in the presence of Ca(ii); the appearance of complex multiplets at lower pH values in the ternary system, relative to the binary system (Fig. 1b), is likely due to the Ca(ii)-induced lowering of the hydroxyl pKa values of naH6, thereby increasing the relative concentration of ternary Ca(ii)–oxoCr(v)–naH6(diolato) species.
These observations were investigated using EPR simulation procedures. The parent Ca(ii)–oxoCr(v)–naH6 signals (at pH values ≥ 4.49) simulated (correlation > 0.998) as comprising two singlets, two quartets, two septets (Table 1) and up to five additional high-field singlets (present in very low (<3.5%) concentrations at pH values ≥ 7.14).
Noteworthy differences between the binary oxoCr(v)–naH6 and ternary Ca(ii)–oxoCr(v)–naH6 systems are as follows.
First, the presence of excess Ca(ii) appears to mitigate against the formation of oxoCr(v)–naH6 species involving coordination via the O7,O8-diolato group, since (unlike the binary system) the simplest simulation model for the Ca(ii)–oxoCr(v)–naH6 system did not require the inclusion of a triplet, a quintet or a sextet to model the ternary analogues of [CrO(O1,O2-naH4)(O7,O8-naH3)]2− (n = 2), [CrO(O7,O8-naH3)2]3− (n = 4) or [CrO(O7,O8-naH3)(O8,O9-naH3)]3− (n = 5), respectively.
Second, an excellent fit between the experimental and simulated spectra for the Ca(ii)–oxoCr(v)–naH6 system was obtained with the inclusion of two isomers each of the singlet, quartet and septet (Table 1).
Individual EPR spectra for each species present in the Ca(ii)–oxoCr(v)–naH6 equilibrium solution at pH = 4.49 are shown in Fig. 2 (RHS) aligned with the spectra from the related binary oxoCr(v)–naH6 species (LHS) at pH = 4.37.
This spectral deconvolution highlights the marked differences in the relative concentrations of related species between the binary oxoCr(v)–naH6 and ternary Ca(ii)–oxoCr(v)–naH6 systems (where the absence of a species is represented by a dotted line).
The sum of the component spectra (purple) in both the binary oxoCr(v)–naH6 (pH = 4.37) and ternary Ca(ii)–oxoCr(v)–naH6 (pH = 4.49) systems closely maps onto the experimental (black) spectrum (Fig. 2; lower trace).
In the binary oxoCr(v)–naH6 system, while the presence of two singlets (Fig. 1a) is evident (ascribed to geometrical isomers of [CrO(O1,O2-naH4)]− in which donor atoms are juxtaposed about the oxoCr(v) trigonal bipyramid),4,9 only one isomer is observed (as determined by the limits of EPR simulation) for the remaining linkage isomers.
Third, the spectral fit in the Ca(ii)–oxoCr(v)–naH6 system required the inclusion of non-uniform 1H aiso values (∼0.59 G, 0.80 G, 0.96 G) for second coordination sphere protons within a single species (Table 1).
This is distinct from the binary oxoCr(v)–naH6 system, where the conformational flexibility of the glycerol tail of naH6 confers magnetic equivalence upon these protons (1H aiso ∼ 0.75 G).
These differences suggest that the interaction between Ca(ii) and naH6, as modelled from NMR spectroscopic data (O1, OR, O7, O8),3 restricts the conformational flexibility of the glycerol tail, effectively acting as an ‘ionic lock’.
The ternary Ca(ii)–oxoCr(v)–naH6 species (two geometrical isomers each) are assigned (Table 1) as {Ca2[CrO(O1,O2-naH4)2]}3+ (CaI (a,b)), {Ca2[CrO(O1,O2-naH4)(O8,O9-naH3)]}2+ (CaIII (a,b); Scheme 2) and {Ca2[CrO(O8,O9-naH3)2]}+ (CaVI (a,b); Scheme 2).
The increase in the strength of the sets of donor atoms (bis-hydroxycarboxylate < hydroxycarboxylate-diolato < bis-diolato) correlates with the increase in the giso values for CaI (a,b), CaIII (a,b) and CaVI (a,b), respectively, which supports the species assignment, together with the signal multiplicities (Table 1).
The stoichiometry of the ternary Ca(ii)–oxoCr(v)–naH6 complexes (2 : 1 : 2) is based upon the known Ca(ii) : naH6 stoichiometry (1 : 1) determined from NMR experiments (even where [Ca(ii)] > [naH6]),2,3 and from studies of oxoCr(v)–bioligand systems that show the preferential formation of bis-chelate species (relative to mono-chelate species) where [ligand] : [Cr(v)] ≥ 2..54,9
The absence of O7,O8-coordinated oxoCr(v)–naH6 species in the ternary Ca(ii)–oxoCr(v)–naH6 system suggests that the O7 group of naH6 has a stronger affinity toward Ca(ii) than toward the oxoCr(v) ion.
Conversely, based upon the presence of O8,O9-coordinated Ca(ii)–oxoCr(v)–naH6 species, the O8 group of naH6 has an affinity toward the oxoCr(v) ion (and may be simultaneously binding Ca(ii)).
The magnetic inequivalence of the protons in the second coordination sphere of ternary Ca(ii)–oxoCr(v)–naH6 complexes (Fig. 2; Table 1) is also explained by the ‘ionic lock’ mechanism, since the {Ca(ii)–naH5}+ structure places H8, H9 and H9′ in unique magnetic environments.3
These environments evidently increase the extent of orbital overlap between the second coordination sphere protons and the dxy oxoCr(v) orbital, as measured by the increased 1H aiso values of the Ca(ii)–oxoCr(v)–naH6 complexes, relative to the binary oxoCr(v)–naH6 analogues.
Also, there are shifts in giso values for related species within the binary oxoCr(v)–naH6 and ternary Ca(ii)–oxoCr(v)–naH6 systems (Fig. 1).
The giso values of the species involving tert-2-hydroxycarboxylate coordination ([CrO(O1,O2-naH4)2]− or {Ca2[CrO(O1,O2-naH4)2]}3+ in the binary or ternary system, respectively) move to higher field (lower giso) in the presence of Ca(ii), while the giso values of diolato coordinated species ([CrO(O8,O9-naH3)2]3− or {Ca2[CrO(O8,O9-naH3)2]}+ in the binary or ternary system, respectively) move to lower field (higher giso) in the presence of Ca(ii).
This latter trend is consistent with [CrO(glycerol(2−))2]− (giso = 1.9800), where in the presence of Ca(ii), giso = 1.9803.
This suggests that in the case of oxoCr(v)–diolato complexes, the presence of Ca(ii) modifies the polarizability of the donor oxygen atom (increases the ‘hardness’), which correlates with an increase in the giso value.
No change in giso value is observed for well characterised tert-2-hydroxycarboxylate oxoCr(v) complexes ([CrO(hmba(2−))2]− (hmba(2−) = 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanoato), giso = 1.9784) in the presence of Ca(ii), which indicates a poor affinity of Ca(ii) towards an isolated hydroxycarboxylate group and suggests that the polyfunctionality of naH6 is an important determinant of Ca(ii) binding.
This is an elegant illustration of the use of EPR spectroscopy in studying competitive metal–carbohydrate binding (termed here ‘metalloglycomics’) that may have wide ranging implications in understanding transition metal–bioligand speciation in Ca(ii)-rich (and/or Mg(ii)) matrices that model the biological milieu.

Pressure perturbation calorimetic studies of the solvation properties and the thermal unfolding of staphylococcal nuclease
A rather new technique, pressure perturbation calorimetry (PPC), was applied to study volumetric and solvation properties of staphylococcal nuclease (Snase) in its native and unfolded state with high precision.
Furthermore, the effects of various chaotropic and cosmotropic co-solvents on the solvation and unfolding behaviour of Snase was investigated in detail.
In PPC, the apparent coefficient of thermal expansion of the protein is deduced from the heat consumed or produced after small isothermal pressure jumps, which strongly depends on the interaction of the protein with the solvent at the protein–solvent interface.
In the native state, the protein shows a very strong thermal expansion of 1.0 × 10−3 K−1 at 10 °C, which decreases steeply to 0.65 × 10−3 K−1 at 40 °C.
This behaviour is discussed in terms of a continuous release of condensed water from the protein surface.
Upon unfolding, the volume decreases by about 19 mL × mol−1.
Solutions of the cosmotropic and chaotropic compounds glycerol, sorbitol, K2SO4 and urea, respectively, show characteristic deviations from the thermal expansion and volumetric properties of the pure buffer solution.
The solvent contribution to the apparent coefficient of thermal expansion of the protein, α, is enhanced considerably when the protein is immersed in a solvent known to be more structured than H2O (even the more structured D2O has a drastic effect) and nearly eliminated in a solvent in which “normal” water is largely absent (e.g., in 1.5 M urea).
Similarly to D2O, a continuous increase in solvation was observed with increase in glycerol or sorbitol content in the buffer, which leads to an increase in protein stability, as is verified by the increasing Tm and ΔH values obtained by microcalorimetric measurements (DSC).
In this regard, sorbitol is the more efficient agent.
The reduction of ΔV in the presence of these stabilisers can in part be attributed to the formation of a partial unfolded state of the protein, in part it is due to the temperature dependence of ΔV.
The preferential binding of urea reduces the hydration level, also in the native state, causing the protein to approach a more disordered state at high urea concentration.
The increase in ΔV and the decrease in ΔH with increasing urea concentration support these conclusions.
A stabilising effect, even though there is a reduction in solvation around the protein is observed for 0.5 M K2SO4 as co-solvent.
In this case, surprisingly, ΔV is found to be positive which is an indication of the formation of a swollen, molten globule kind of unfolded state at the transition.
Finally, ΔV values for the temperature-induced unfolding are compared with corresponding data for the pressure-induced unfolding of Snase.
The in depth knowledge of various thermodynamical properties of proteins in solution has been drawing attention of many researchers, as these form the basis for understanding their physiological functions, but also their use in drug design and formulations.
The stability of globular proteins depends on temperature,1–4 solvent properties,5–8 and its hydration capacity.9,10
Another important factor contributing to the stability of proteins is their relative affinity towards a particular reagent (in the present context, a co-solvent) in comparison to water or buffer solution.
The use of co-solvents such as glycerol and sucrose have been used widely, primarily because of their ability to stabilize the folded proteins through a mechanism that does not involve direct contact, but rather their preferential exclusion from the protein surface.11
Brandts12 and Pohl13,14 proposed that the driving force for stabilizing the protein folded conformation is a non-specific solvation effect in which the preferential exclusion of the co-solvents from the protein surface arises from enhanced water ordering (structure makers).
In contrast, when denaturating co-solvents bind to proteins, water–protein and water–co-solvent interactions, that occur in the unbound state, are replaced by relatively stronger co-solvent–protein interactions in the bound state with concomitant release of water molecules into the bulk phase.
Furthermore, these compounds tend to reduce the solvent ordering (structure breakers).
Such ligand interactions can be studied based on determining the solvent accessible surface area (SASA).15,16
The structure-making and structure-breaking tendencies of these compounds on protein-bound water have been studied extensively by Lin et al.17
Their results indicate that when hydrophilic groups, such as charged or polar side chains of proteins, are exposed or come in contact with the surrounding water, they show a pattern characteristic of structure breakers, with a large positive apparent expansion coefficient of the protein, in particular at low temperature, which decreases drastically with increasing temperature.
On the contrary, apolar, hydrophobic amino acid side groups act in the reverse manner, as structure makers, by enhancing the space consuming hydrogen-bonded network structure of water, particularly at low temperature.
This is accompanied by a decrease in solvent density around the hydrophobic groups.
Aliphatic side chains, for example, are known to have even negative apparent thermal expansion coefficients, α, at low temperatures (near 0 °C) with a large positive temperature coefficient.
Increasing thermal energy, however, allows the water molecules to free themselves from this expanded ordered solvation state.
Hence, in general, for proteins in dilute aqueous solutions, the temperature dependent thermal expansion coefficient at the protein–solvent interface is dominated by protein–water interactions, which arise mainly from interactions between the protein groups with the surrounding hydration layer.
Irrespective of whether co-solvents directly interact with or are preferentially excluded from the protein surface, they induce definite changes in the quantity of bound water and its associated properties, such as hydrogen-bonded structure, and chemical potential.18–22
Densimetric studies are often not of sufficient sensitivity to reveal these changes in solvation properties or volume changes upon unfolding of proteins.22–25
In the present paper, we examine these perturbations in the hydration layer around a protein caused by addition of co-solvents using a relatively new and efficient technique called pressure perturbation calorimetry (PPC).17,26–28
Applying this method, determination of the thermal expansion coefficient and relative volume changes, ΔV/V, upon unfolding of proteins in solution has advantages over densimetric measurements since its sensitivity is higher by more than one order of magnitude.17,29–31
This high sensitivity is a prerequisite for such studies, as the expansivity and the volume change upon unfolding, which can be either positive of negative, are usually very small (ΔV/V < 0.3%).
The observed volume and expansivity changes are correlated with further thermodynamic properties obtained from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).
Taken together, these data lead to a deeper understanding of the solvation process of proteins in different co-solvents in their native and unfolded states.
We have chosen to study the solvation properties and stability of a well characterized monomeric protein, staphylococcal nuclease (Snase), in H2O and D2O buffer solutions, as well as in the presence of various types of co-solvents, such as glycerol, sorbitol, urea and potassium sulfate.
Their influence on the expansivity as well as the denaturation temperature, relative volume and enthalpy changes upon unfolding were obtained with high accuracy.
Snase is a small protein of about 17.5 kDa containing 149 amino acid residues and no disulfide bonds.
It has an extraordinarily high fraction of ionisable groups.
The X-ray diffraction pattern of native crystalline Snase32 reveals that in the crystalline state the protein contains 26.2% helices, 24.8% β-sheets (barrel), 7.4% extended chains, 24.8% turns and loops, and 8.7% unordered chains, and the remaining 8.1% is uncertain.
Volume and expansivity changes of Snase upon pressure and acid induced denaturation were given elsewhere33–37 and are compared with these data.
The present study aims to obtain more insight into the basic thermodynamic properties of protein solvation and volume effects accompanying unfolding scenarios on one hand, and on the other hand, to initiate further potential applications of pressure perturbation calorimetry in studies of biomolecular systems in general.
Recombinant Snase with the sequence of nuclease A from the V8 strain of Staphylococcus aureus was obtained using the λ expression system in the Escherichia coli strain Arλ9 as described by Shortle and Lin.38
The cells were grown according to the procedure described by Shortle et al39. except that SB rather than MOPS media was employed.
The protein purification was carried out according to the method described by Shortle and Meeker40 with modifications described by Frye et al.41
Potassium sulfate (K2SO4), deuterium oxide (D2O) were obtained from Aldrich, urea and D-sorbitol from Fluka, and glycerol from Merck.
The chemicals were used without further purification.
10 mM of phosphate buffer (di-sodium hydrogen phosphate, anhydrous, from Merck) was used for all experiments.
The thermal unfolding of Snase was measured by means of a high precision VP DSC micro-calorimeter from MicroCal, Northamption, MA, USA.
The cell volume is 0.51 mL.
The reference cell was filled with matching buffer.
Both buffer and protein solutions were degassed before being injected into the respective cells.
Degassing was performed at a slightly reduced atmospheric pressure and for a short time only, so that no concentration changes occurred.
The instrument was operated in the high gain mode at a rate of 40 °C h−1 for all experiments.
The instrument is also equipped with a pressuring cap that allows application of ca.
1.8 bar to the cells in order to avoid air bubbles at elevated temperatures.
Sample concentration of Snase in 10 mM phosphate buffer was 0.2 wt% with a known quantity of co-solvent.
Baseline subtraction (pure buffer) and normalization with respect to protein concentration were performed by the instrument software, yielding the temperature-dependent apparent molar heat capacity of the protein, Cp.
The pressure perturbation (PPC) experiments were performed in the DSC calorimeter using the MicroCal PPC accessory.
The reference and sample cell volume are identical (0.51 mL) and they open to a common pressure chamber containing a sensor.
An equal pressure of 5 bar was applied to both cells in a programmed manner using nitrogen gas.
The pressure effect on the sample volume is negligibly small (0.02%).
The protein concentration used for the PPC studies was ca.
4 mg mL−1.
Each pressure jump starts with equilibration at 5 bar pressure of the calorimeter in the isothermal high gain and low noise modes at the desired temperature with 0.02 °C tolerance.
The software then initiates a pressure release to ambient pressure.
The temperature of the cell is kept constant by active compensation of the heat change caused by the pressure jump.
The compensation power returns to the baseline typically within one minute and integration of the supplied power vs. time yields the heat consumed or released by the sample.
After complete equilibration, automatically checked by an adjustable slope criterion, an upward pressure jump is applied when the PPC controller reconnects the PPC cells with nitrogen gas.
The heat peak of compressed and decompressed pressures should agree in absolute values; they are of opposite sign, however.
For both compression and decompression experiments, temperature, pressure, and heat flow are recorded as a function of time.
The calorimeter is then automatically heated or cooled to the next desired temperature and the next two pressure jumps are applied.
Various pH variation studies from 2 to 9 on Snase using DSC indicated that it is most stable at pH 5.5 in 10 mM phosphate buffer.
As the technique has been introduced quite recently only,17,26–28,31 we briefly summarize the thermodynamics on which it is based.
From the second law of thermodynamics we know that an entropy change for a reversible process carried out at temperature T, whose heat change is dQrev, can be written as dS = dQrev/T.
Differentiation with respect to pressure, at constant T, gives (∂Qrev/∂p)T = T (∂S/∂p)T.
Using the Maxwell relation (∂S/∂p)T = −(∂V/∂T)p, we obtain eqn. (1): where V is the volume and α is the coefficient of thermal expansion, (1/V)(∂V/∂T)p.
Here it is assumed that V and α are nearly invariant within small pressure changes (here 5 bar), which is a very good approximation for all liquids.
Integration of eqn. (1), at constant temperature, over a small pressure range, Δp, gives the working equation for calculating α The coefficient of thermal expansion, α, can thus be determined from an isothermal measurement of the heat consumed or released upon small pressure changes.
Here, ΔQrev is the heat difference between the sample cell that contains the dissolved sample, and the reference cell, which contains the same solvent, upon the pressure changes Δp.
Moreover, the relative volume changes ΔV/V at the unfolding transition, taking place in the temperature range from To to Te, can be obtained by eqn. (3): 
In extending eqn. (2) to protein solute (in buffer solvent) and solvent (buffer only) binary component systems, we obtain eqn. (4): where α and αsolv are the thermal expansion coefficients of the protein and solvent, respectively, and Vcell is the active cell volume.17,26
The experiment thus yields the difference in expansivity between the protein solution (sample cell) and the buffer (reference cell).
The apparent expansion coefficient of the protein is measured, which includes changes in hydrational properties at the protein surface with regard to the pure solvent system.
The uncertainties in α determined from at least three measurements using different sample preparations is ±0.05 × 10−3 K−1.
The values of the expansion coefficients of the solvents, αsolv, measured for the phosphate buffer containing 0.5 M co-solvents are shown in Fig. 1.
The solutions with 0.5 M glycerol, sorbitol, urea, and K2SO4 exhibit a greater thermal expansion compared to pure water (shown for comparison), in particular at low temperature.
In the case of K2SO4, above 80 °C, however, its expansivity becomes smaller than that of pure water, which is likely due to the “structure making” effect of the salt.
Fig. 2a represents PPC curves of the apparent expansion coefficient, α(T), of 0.4 wt% Snase dissolved in 10 mM phosphate buffer at pH 5.5, from which α at different temperatures, the midpoint of thermal unfolding (Tm) and the relative volume change upon unfolding, ΔV/V, are obtained.
Tm and the enthalpy change of the transition (ΔH) are obtained from the DSC experiments (Fig. 2b).
The protein begins to unfold (onset temperature) at ca.
43 °C and the temperature of the unfolding midpoint, Tm, was found to be 51.5 °C.
The enthalpy change obtained by integration over the DSC peak amounts to 178 ± 5 kJ mol−1.
We find an increase in Cp of 5.7 ± 0.2 kJ mol−1 K−1 between the unfolded and native state.
Between 10 and 40 °C, the apparent thermal expansion coefficient of the protein, α, decreases almost linearly from 1.0 × 10−3 K−1 to a value near 0.65 × 10−3 K−1.
At approximately 51.7 °C, where the DSC curve Cp(T) exhibits its maximum, a distinct dip is observed.
Above that temperature, α increases again to a relatively constant level in the post-transition temperature range.
Above 70 °C, α then decreases again.
High α values at lower temperatures (1.0 × 10−3 K−1 at 10 °C) and their steep decrease up to 40 °C (dα/dT)10–40 = −1.17 × 10−5 K−2) are indicative of the presence of a large number of structure-breaking hydrophilic side chains on the surface of Snase.17
As the temperature increases, water molecules are released from the surface and the value of the thermal expansivity is reduced.
Since Snase has an extraordinarily large number of ionisable residues (39%), it exhibits very large values of α and |(dα/dT)10–40|.
The relative volume change upon unfolding, ΔV/V, as obtained from the area under the transitional peak, is calculated by integrating the α(T) transition curve (after baseline subtraction); ΔV/V = −1.5 × 10−3.
The absolute volume change upon unfolding, ΔV, can be calculated from ΔV/V using the molar mass of Snase (16 812 Da) and its partial specific volume (0.754 mL g−1)33 which yields ΔV = −19 mL mol−1, which is of the order of −0.15% of the whole system.
In agreement with the DSC data, the transition has been found to be reversible up to temperatures of 80 °C.
The effect of solvation strength on the temperature dependence of α, which is largely controlled by protein–solvent interactions, should be expected to change significantly upon replacing H2O for D2O as solvent.
Fig. 3a shows PPC results of Snase in dilute buffer prepared from D2O (Snase – D2O) in comparison to those of Snase in H2O (Snase – H2O).
From this figure it is clear that in the lower temperature region, the negative slope of α(T) is considerably enhanced in D2O: (dα/dT)10–40 = −2.2 × 10−5 K−2 in Snase–D2O, whereas (dα/dT)10–40 = −1.17 × 10−5 K−2 for Snase in dilute buffer prepared from H2O. The larger absolute (dα/dT)10–40 value in the case of Snase–D2O points to a higher degree of solvation than in the Snase–H2O system.17
D2O has a stronger structuring tendency which, in contact with structure-breaking protein groups results in a relatively larger solvation layer around the protein surface.15
The decrease in thermal expansivity with temperature is indeed largely controlled by the net structure-breaking tendencies of the polar protein groups interacting with water.
This is not to say that the intrinsic expansivity of the protein is negligible, but simply that the protein interior does not appear to contribute significantly to the decrease in expansivity with increasing temperature (see below).
The Tm value shifts from 51.5 °C in H2O to 56 °C in D2O. Furthermore, there is a ca.
33% reduction in ΔV (ΔV = −12.7 mL mol−1 for Snase–D2O).
All the results are listed in Table 1.
Concerning Tm values, similar results as from PPC were obtained from the DSC traces of Snase in D2O and H2O, respectively.
From Fig. 3b it is clear that there is a shift in Tm from 51.7 °C in H2O to 56.3 °C in D2O. We observe also a considerable increase in the enthalpy of unfolding in D2O. The transition enthalpy change of the system Snase–D2O (ΔH ≈ 227 kJ mol−1) is ca.
25% greater than that of the system Snase–H2O (ΔH ≈ 178 kJ mol−1), which is, again, an indication that the protein is more stable in D2O. Such an enhancement of the structure of a solvation layer contributing to the protein stability was also reported elsewhere43,44.
Glycerol and other polyolic co-solvents have been shown to lead to a “preferential hydration” of the protein, i.e. the exclusion of the co-solvent molecules from the protein surface.
Hence, in their presence proteins are preferentially hydrated.18,45–51
For sugars (e.g., sucrose), glycerol and polyhydric alcohols (e.g., ethylene glycerol, sorbitol), the preferential hydration was found to induce also protein stabilization.
Glycerol, being a strongly hydrophilic co-solvent, interacts strongly with H2O and has a weaker affinity for the polar residues on the protein surface, thus leading to preferential hydration of the protein.
Furthermore, the steric exclusion principle should make the distance of closest approach of a co-solvent with a larger molecular volume greater than that of water.
As a result, the volume fraction occupied by the co-solvent at the surface of the protein should be less than that in the bulk solvent.
Thermodynamically, this thus also manifests itself as preferential hydration.
Upon denaturation, the surface of the protein increases, which results in an enhanced preferential hydration of the denatured protein relative to the native protein.51,52
The PPC results of Snase dissolved at various molar concentrations of glycerol in 10 mM phosphate buffer at pH 5.5 are shown in Fig. 4a.
The glycerol concentration in the buffer was varied from 0.5 M (ca.
5 wt%) to 3.5 M (ca.
32 wt%).
From the figure it can be clearly seen that there is a continuous increase in α, |(dα/dT)10–40|, and Tm values with increasing glycerol concentration.
The increase in Tm value is clearly an evidence of the stabilization of the folded state, arising from the energetically unfavourable increase in preferential hydration due to the increase in exposed surface area upon unfolding.
Similar results were obtained for the Snase–D2O system (data not shown).
The increase in glycerol concentration leads to a drastic increase of the thermal expansivity at 10 °C due to the preferential hydration, even though the total amount of water in the system is reduced with increasing glycerol concentration.
The comparison of the (dα/dT)10–40 value of Snase–3.5 M glycerol (−2.4 × 10−5 K−2) with that of Snase–H2O (−1.17 × 10−5 K−2) in buffer solution indicates that the addition of glycerol contributes to a ca.
100% increase in solvation, assuming that (dα/dT)10–40 is proportional to the degree of solvation.
The possibility of extensive glycerol binding to the protein, even at high glycerol concentration, might be ruled out because in such a case part of the water should be expelled from the protein surface to accommodate glycerol which would lead to a decrease in α and hence |(dα/dT)10–40|.
The values of Tm from DSC (Fig. 4b) and PPC are in good agreement.
The steady increment of Tm and ΔH in the glycerol containing buffer solutions, up to 56 °C and ΔH ≈ ∼260 kJ mol−1 for the 3.5 M glycerol containing solution (Table 1), confirms the continuous increase in protein stability with increasing glycerol concentration.
The volume change of unfolding is drastically reduced for the glycerol solvent systems (e.g., ca.
100% for the 3.5 M glycerol solution), which might be due to a less disordered unfolded state.
This would be in agreement with the smaller ΔCp values as obtained by DSC (Table 1).
Several reports state that stabilisation of proteins in the presence of sorbitol, which is about twice as large as glycerol, is also mainly due to it being excluded from the surface of the protein,47,51i.e., in their presence, proteins are preferentially hydrated.
To quantify the relative hydration changes, PPC experiments were also conducted using 0.5 M (ca.
9 wt%) and 1.5 M (ca.
27 wt%) sorbitol as co-solvents in 10 mM phosphate buffer.
The PPC results are shown in Fig. 5a and indicate that the hydration changes and stabilisation due to sorbitol are even higher than those for the corresponding concentrations of glycerol (Table 1).
The comparison of (dα/dT)10–40 values of Snase–1.5 M sorbitol (−1.7 × 10−5 K−2) and Snase–1.5 M glycerol (−1.5 × 10−5 K−2) indicates that there is an ca.
12% increase in solvation of the native protein in the sorbitol containing solvent, which also acts as a more effective stabilising agent.
The shift in Tm value, e.g., from 51.5 to 58.6 °C in 1.5 M sorbitol (53.7 °C in 1.5 M glycerol) indicates the more effective stabilising effect of sorbitol compared to glycerol.
The volume change upon unfolding is much smaller, −5 mL mol−1 in 1.5 M sorbitol as compared to −16 mL mol−1 in 1.5 M glycerol and −19 mL mol−1 in the pure phosphate buffer system.
The high ΔH (ca.
208 kJ mol−1) and Tm (59 °C) values obtained from the DSC data, which are shown in Fig. 5b, are in good agreement with the conclusions drawn from the PPC results.
It is well known that the destabilising nature of the chaotropic agent urea on protein stability is caused by binding efficiently to the unfolded state of the protein, compared to the folded state, due to exposure of more binding sites upon unfolding.52,53
The PPC and DSC results on Snase–urea solutions displayed in Fig. 6 are in agreement with these general findings.
As expected, the Tm value decreases with increasing urea concentration, for example Tm(1.5 M urea) = 39.1 °C, Tm(2.5 M urea) = 32.5 °C (Table 1).
The α values at low temperature are much smaller than those of the pure Snase–H2O system, and the absolute value of dα/dT, taken between 10 °C and the onset temperature of the denaturation peak, also decreases with increasing urea concentration (Fig. 6a).
These effects are related to specific binding of urea to the polypeptide, thereby replacing water molecules and releasing them into the bulk phase, such that the hydration of the protein is largely diminished in the presence of urea, prior to denaturation.
Interestingly, the ΔV values of Snase–0.5 M urea and Snase–1.5 M urea buffer solutions with −32 and −56 mL mol−1, respectively, are much greater than those of Snase in the pure buffer solution.
Beyond a concentration of 1.5 M of urea, it is not possible to calculate ΔV accurately as the protein does not denaturate in a cooperative manner anymore.
This is supported by the reduction in the enthalpy values of denaturation, ΔH, as calculated from the DSC data, which are shown in Fig. 6b.
ΔH values are 168 and 108 kJ mol−1 for the 0.5 and 1.5 M urea containing solutions, i.e., they decreased by ca.
6% and ca.
39%, respectively, when compared to Snase–H2O (buffer).
The Tm values as obtained by DSC also decrease with increasing urea concentration and are in good agreement with the values obtained by the PPC method.
Above a concentration of 2.5 M urea, no clear transition can be observed anymore.
All experimental data are again listed in Table 1.
In the case of urea, an increase in absolute ΔV values is observed at the unfolding transition, which is an indication that the protein tends to form a rather extended structure, and the solvation properties at the protein surface are probably largely determined by binding of urea.
As a consequence, the α values in the denatured state are rather small.
Some specific anions are known to induce the formation of molten globule forms in proteins, for example from acid-unfolded proteins.54
The mechanism of stabilisation by anions is due to a reduction of the net positive charge on the protein through anion binding.
Stabilisation of proteins due to the presence of such salts are thus more effective at lower pH than at neutral pH.55
At reduced protein surface charge and at higher anion concentrations, the Hofmeister effects46,55 prevail, however.
Hofmeister anions interact favourably with the peptide groups whereas they interact unfavourably with the nonpolar peptide side chains.
Sulfate, for example, is known to be a good protein stabilizer, because sulfate strongly salts out nonpolar compounds and only weakly interacts with and thus salts in the peptide group.55
Here, we looked at the role of the cosmotropic salt K2SO4 in a solvent environment where the net charge of the protein is still small.
Under these conditions, the K2SO4 specific binding tendency is reduced.
The PPC and DSC results for Snase dissolved in 0.5 M K2SO4 buffer solution are presented in Figs. 7a and 7b, respectively.
From the PPC experiments it is clear that the shift in the Tm value from 51.5 to 59.5 °C is an indication that the salt acts as a strong stabilising agent.
In contrast to the osmolytes glycerol and sorbitol, the apparent expansion coefficient of the protein in the native state is smaller than that of the protein in pure buffer solution, however.
The value of (dα/dT)10–40 = −0.77 × 10−5 K−2 obtained for the K2SO4 system is ca.
30% less than that of the Snase–H2O (buffer) system.
In the present case, even though there is a net reduction in solvation, similar to urea, the K2SO4–buffer system increases the stability of the protein.
The high ΔH value of ca.
295 kJ mol−1 obtained from the DSC results indicates the drastically increased stability of the protein in the K2SO4 buffer solution.
Surprisingly, in this and only in this case, ΔV becomes positive (ΔV = 19 mL mol−1).
This volume increase at the unfolding transition could be due to the formation of a protein conformation which is not fully unfolded but rather achieves a flexible, expanded state only, which might be a molten globule kind of structure.
In the unfolded state at ca.
80 °C, α is similar to that of the pure buffer system, again.
The interpretation of the present results must be made in the context of previously published work on the volumetric properties of Snase (and proteins in general) as a function of temperature and pressure.
Direct densimetric measurements on Snase as a function of temperature and pressure36 revealed that below the unfolding transition temperature at atmospheric pressure, the slope of the change in specific volume with temperature exhibits a distinct downward curvature, indicating that the apparent thermal expansivity of the native state of the solvated protein decreases with increasing temperature.
The present more accurate studies are in good agreement with these earlier observations, as they demonstrate a marked decrease in α between 4 and 40 °C, below the transition temperature.
At higher temperatures, between 55 and 65 °C, our earlier studies show that the increase in specific volume with temperature was nearly linear, i.e. the thermal expansivity appeared nearly constant over this temperature range.
In the present study, it is seen that this temperature range corresponds to the tail end of the transition, and thus to the region of rollover in which dα/dT ≈ 0 before changing sign.
Thus, the present determination of α as a function of temperature using PPC is in good agreement with the previous observations based on a determination of the specific volume by densimetry, which had to be carried out at a much higher (20×) protein concentration, however.
The estimation, based on the present PPC results, of the change in α upon unfolding, Δα, at the transition temperature yields a positive value of about 1 × 10−4 K−1, and is in the range (0.5–1.5 × 10−4 K−1) of the values obtained by Lin et al17. on a number of proteins.
Our earlier densimetric measurements also revealed an increase in the apparent value of the expansivity between 45 and 65 °C, consistent with a positive value for Δα.
Intrinsic protein volume, including the effects of protonation and deprotonation of amino acids upon unfolding, volume changes due to thermal motions and changes in water structure at the protein surface are the three major factors contributing to the apparent thermal expansivity of a protein.42,56
The thermal volume at the protein solvent interface and the intrinsic volume of the protein increase with temperature leading to a positive contribution to α.
The thermal expansivity of the protein interior has been measured over a limited temperature range, essentially using fluorescence and X-ray diffraction (on single crystals),57–60 and the changes observed are rather small.
This is in accord with our SAXS measurements of the radius of gyration, Rg, of Snase in solution; within the accuracy of our data (±1–2 Å), the Rgvalue is unchanged up to ca.
40 °C.34,61
The solvation effect also represents a positive contribution to the thermal expansivity, but is expected to decrease with increasing temperature.
This behaviour is due to the fact that the protein surface binds adjacent water.
Vicinal water molecules may be oriented to the surface charges leading to a more or less layered structure.17,62,63
This layering is probably substantial at low temperature, and thermal activation leads to a continuous release of this “condensed” water from the protein surface.
Once the water is released, it no longer contributes to the partial volume of the protein and hence to α.
Thus at low temperatures, the solvation effect (in particular, of the polar/charged peptide groups) leads to large positive contributions to α and will decrease steeply with increasing temperature.
Lin et al17. proposed that the dα/dT value of a protein in its native state is a direct measure of the solvation contribution to the volume expansivity.
The volume change that accompanies the unfolding transition of a protein (in this case Snase) clearly will depend upon the temperature at which the transition occurs.
The value of ΔV at the transition temperature of 51.5 °C obtained in this study (−19 mL mol−1) is smaller than those reported in denaturation studies by pressure36 or acid induced33 denaturation.
However, the acid denaturation studies may include significant electrostriction effects.
More to the point, the pressure-induced unfolding was carried out over a temperature range of 4 to 45 °C, below the unfolding transition temperature.34
These pressure studies demonstrated that the absolute value of the volume change upon unfolding was strongly temperature dependent, decreasing significantly in magnitude with increasing temperature.
At 40 °C, the ΔV was near −65 ± 10 mL mol−1, whereas at 45 °C it had decreased in absolute value to −37 mL mol−1.
Our previous data were not of high enough quality to determine whether this temperature dependence of ΔV was linear or non-linear.
However, one can assume that at 52.5 °C it would have decreased to at least −25 mL mol−1, a value within experimental error of that determined in the present studies.
It is possible, however, that differences in ΔV values may also arise from differences in the structure of the denatured states at high temperature as compared to high pressure.
Studies involving the application of hydrostatic pressure to solutions of native proteins have demonstrated that at temperatures below that corresponding to the unfolding transition, the volume change upon unfolding of proteins is negative, i.e. the partial specific volume of the unfolded state is smaller than that of the folded state and therefore pressure induces unfolding.64,65
Early work on metmyoglobin66 and ribonuclease67 and later on Snase as noted above34 has also shown that the pressure effect decreases in magnitude with increasing temperature, and may even change sign, i.e., the partial specific volume of the unfolded state becomes larger than that of the folded state at high temperature and pressure can induce folding, rather than unfolding under these conditions.
Moreover, even though it is negative at low temperatures, the absolute value of the volume change upon unfolding is quite small.
Thus, clearly the value and sign of the volume change upon unfolding at higher temperature will depend upon how the thermal expansivities of folded and unfolded states change with temperature.
Unfortunately, the temperature dependence of the thermal expansivity of the unfolded state cannot be determined at temperatures below the transition temperature, while that of the folded state cannot be determined at temperatures above the transition temperature.
Nonetheless, since Δα is positive at the transition temperature, the expansivity of the unfolded state is higher than that of the folded state at the transition.
As the temperature is lowered, it is likely that α of the unfolded state increases, but probably to a lesser degree than that of the folded state.
This might be due to the fact that relatively more aliphatic side chains of the protein are exposed to the solvent in the unfolded state, and the temperature dependence of the thermal expansivity of aliphatic side chains is opposite to that of the polar side chains and peptide bonds, given the fact that the aliphatic groups tend to promote a higher degree of structure in the water of solvation than exists in bulk water.17
Thus, as temperature is lowered this ordering significantly reduces the expansivity.
Aromatic groups as well are exposed to the solvent in the unfolded state, whereas they are significantly less exposed in the folded state.
The temperature dependence of the thermal expansivity of these groups is very small.
Thus overall, while the thermal expansivity of the unfolded state is likely to be higher than that of the folded state (at least near the transition temperature), its temperature dependence is probably reduced in comparison.
Given that the specific volume of the unfolded state is smaller at low temperature than that of the folded state, the temperature evolution of the specific volume of the two states may be similar to that schematized in Fig. 8.
Such a scheme of the individual contributing factors to the volume change upon unfolding changes as a function of temperature.
At low temperature, the volume change upon unfolding, ΔV, is negative because elimination of internal cavities and electrostrictive effects around exposed polar groups upon unfolding offset the positive contributions of exposure of hydrophobic groups and the larger thermal volume of the unfolded state.
At higher temperature, the decreased solvation effect can no longer offset the larger thermal volume of the unfolded state compared to the unfolded state, and the ΔV changes sign.
The Δα and ΔCp values for Snase in phosphate buffer solution at pH 5.5 are 0.12 × 10−3 K−1 and 5.7 kJ mol−1 K−1, respectively.
These values are taken as a reference to compare relative SASAs in the presence of the various co-solvents.
The larger absolute (dα/dT)10–40 value in the case of Snase–D2O points to a higher solvation than that of the Snase–H2O system.
D2O has a stronger structuring tendency which, in contact with structure-breaking protein groups results in a relatively larger solvation layer around the protein surface.
For the Snase in glycerol, the changes in expansivity and heat capacity upon unfolding indicate a decrease compared to those measured in pure buffer, indicating a compaction of the unfolded state as the glycerol concentration increases.
This would be in agreement with the reduced ΔV values observed.
Indeed, glycerol has been found to decrease the specific volume and the adiabatic compressibility of the protein interior, suggesting that the mechanism involves the collapse of voids in the protein core following a glycerol-induced elimination of flexibility-associated (“lubricant”) water.45
However, in pressure unfolding experiments on Snase at 21 °C as a function of increasing osmolyte concentration (in that case xylose up to ca.
0.5 M), we observed that while the apparent free energy of unfolding increased with increasing xylose concentration as would be expected, the volume change of unfolding remained essentially constant.68
One explanation for this discrepancy between previous studies and the present can be found in the temperature dependence of the volume change, which is quite large.
Indeed, addition of osmolyte stabilizes the folded state, such that the Tm (the temperature at which ΔV is measured in the present experiments) increases with increasing glycerol concentration.
Since the volume change of unfolding decreases strongly with increasing temperature, we can conclude that at least part of the observed effect of glycerol on the ΔV is due to the increase in temperature.
A similar but inverse explanation may also hold for the observed increase in the absolute value of ΔV as a function of increasing urea concentration.
Indeed, urea destabilizes the folded state of the protein leading to a decrease in the Tm as a function of increasing urea concentration.
Since the ΔV is of larger absolute value as the temperature decreases, increasing urea concentration results automatically in a larger absolute value of ΔV.
Another contribution may be that increasing urea concentration leads to a more completely unfolded state.
We observed that there is a continuous decrease in Δα which finally approaches zero with increasing urea concentration.
This could arise from significant binding of urea to the protein in the pre- and post-transitional temperature range.
The excess area available after protein denaturation would be occupied by the remaining free urea molecules, such that electrostatic or hydrophobic hydration effects could be largely reduced.
We note in contrast to this explanation, that another effective denaturant, guanidinium hydrochloride, had no effect on the value of the volume change of unfolding obtained in the pressure-induced unfolding of Snase at 21 °C,69 indicating that such solvation effects do not play a role in the value of the volume change under those high pressure conditions.
Moreover, the radius of gyration observed for urea denatured Snase (35 Å)70,71 is smaller than that which we observed by temperature denaturation (45 Å),34 indicating that, on the contrary, urea leads to a more ordered unfolded state than does temperature.
However, it is altogether possible that the combination of both temperature and urea significantly destabilizes residual interactions in the unfolded state compared to either perturbation alone.
Very interesting observations are made when the protein is stabilised in the presence of the salt K2SO4.
Firstly, ΔV being positive is probably an indication of the dominance of the thermal volume expansion due to an increase in the dynamics of backbone and side chains of the protein over the internal dead volume being exposed during denaturation.
The state might be characterized by a swollen, molten globule kind of state.
The experimental Δα and ΔCp values of −0.03 × 10−3 K−1 and ca. −9.5 kJ mol−1 K−1 (Table 1), respectively, point to no drastic increase in SASA in the denatured state, again indicative of a less unfolded and hence less hydrophobically hydrated structure in the denatured state.
This state can be achieved only, if K2SO4–H2O interactions dominate over Snase–K2SO4–H2O interactions and specific anion binding is largely missing.
Pressure perturbation calorimetry has been found to be an effective tool for measuring the thermal expansion coefficient and volume changes of biomolecular systems with very high precision.
Accurate information related to solvent binding, ligand binding and volume changes during unfolding and denaturation of proteins can be obtained by this technique.
The observed thermodynamic data obtained drastically depend on the interfacial solvent conditions, which drastically influence the structural and dynamic behaviour of the biomolecular system.
We clearly demonstrate that solvation properties contribute extensively towards the stability of proteins.
The apparent expansion coefficient of the protein, α, is strongly dependent on the type and concentration of co-solvent and its interactions with functional groups of the polypeptide.
This effect is already clearly observed when the thermodynamic data obtained using water as solvent are compared with those of a chemically structurally similar solvent, D2O. The increase in thermal stability of the protein in the presence of D2O can be understood to be due to an increase in solvation around the protein as indicated by the much larger α value in the native state of the protein.
The solvation effects leading to the strong temperature dependence of α are controlled by two contributions.
Firstly, as shown in the seminal paper by Lin et al.,17 hydrophobic groups known to act as structure-makers in water have a large positive slope and a negative curvature in α(T) plots, while structure-breaking hydrophilic groups show the opposite behaviour.
For charged and polar groups, α(T) curves exhibit a large negative slope and a positive curvature.
Since the solvation effects of a protein are dominated by hydrophilic groups, both the native and unfolded protein exhibit a net structure-breaking profile for α(T).
Upon unfolding of the Snase, the internal dead volume becomes accessible to water (leading to a decrease in system volume) and the dynamics of the protein backbone, and amino acid side chains increases thus leading to an increase of the thermal volume.
Moreover, the water-accessible surface area becomes larger upon unfolding, thus increasing the number of water molecules being affected.
The surface term may reflect two contributions: Firstly, since charged or polar surface-affected water is supposed to be condensed, this will give rise to a negative contribution to ΔV.
Secondly, upon unfolding of the surface, the protein becomes more hydrophobic because the native structure tends to bury more of the hydrophobic side chains in the interior.
It can be supposed that this effect counteracts the first one to some extent.
The negative volume change upon unfolding observed under most conditions implies that at the transition temperature, the opening of void volume and the increase in accessible surface area with more charged and polar groups upon unfolding overcompensate the positive effects of thermal volume and the decrease in the hydrophilic to hydrophobic balance of the surface area.
Similarly to D2O, a continuous increase in solvation was observed with increase in glycerol or sorbitol content in the buffer, hence indicating that they act as protein stabilisers, as is indeed verified by the increasing Tm and ΔH values.
The values of ΔV and ΔCp are also smaller for these co-solvents.
The observed reduction in absolute value of ΔV in the presence of these stabilisers may be in part attributed to the formation of a partially unfolded state of the protein (which is consistent with a smaller change in heat capacity upon unfolding) and in part directly due to the temperature dependence of ΔV; as Tm increases, ΔV decreases (in absolute value).
On the contrary, the chaotropic agent urea destabilizes the protein by direct ligand binding and restricts direct water contact with the protein surface.
This preferential binding of urea to the protein reduces the hydration level causing the protein to approach a disordered, random coil-like state at high urea concentration.
The increase in ΔV and the decrease in ΔH with increasing urea concentration support these conclusions, although a significant contribution to the increase in ΔV arises as well from its temperature dependence; as Tm decreases ΔV increases in absolute value.
The Δα and ΔCp values are less affected by changes in hydrophilic and hydrophobic hydration, which is attributed to the strong ligand binding of urea with the protein.
A stabilising effect, even though there is a reduction in solvation around the protein (|Δα/ΔT10–40| is ca.
30% lower compared to the pure buffer system) is also observed for 0.5 M K2SO4 as co-solvent.
Near pH 5.5, K2SO4 is still left with little chance to bind strongly to the protein.
Yet, the sulfate anions are still able to decrease the hydration layer around the protein.
In this case, ΔV is found to be positive which is an indication of the formation of a swollen, molten globule kind of unfolded state at the transition.
Indeed, the negative values for Δα and ΔCp in presence of this salt point to no marked increase in SASA upon unfolding.
These results for the various chaotropic and cosmotropic co-solvents clearly show that the co-solvent not only markedly changes the stability of Snase, but also its solvation, and perhaps also the structures of the denatured state.
More generally, the present results on Snase combined with the few previously reported studies on other small globular proteins17 demonstrate that the PPC technique provides an exquisitely sensitive handle on the hydration properties of proteins in solution, the understanding of which is prerequisite to a global comprehension of protein stability and dynamics.
A heartwood norlignan, (E)-hinokiresinol, is formed from 4-coumaryl 4-coumarate by a Cryptomeria japonica enzyme preparation
An enzyme preparation from the cultured cells of Cryptomeria japonica catalyses the formation of a heartwood norlignan, (E)-hinokiresinol, from two distinct phenylpropanoid monomers: 4-coumaroyl CoA and 4-coumaryl alcohol, and from a dimer: 4-coumaryl 4-coumarate.
Norlignans, which have the 1,3-diarylpentane structure, are found in coniferous trees (especially heartwood) and some monocotyledonous plants, including Asparagus officinalis.1,2
Their biosynthesis is especially of interest in relation to heartwood formation, a metabolic event specific to woody plants.1–3
Hinokiresinol is the simplest of the norlignans and therefore a good target for norlignan biosynthetic studies.
Hinokiresinol has two geometrical (E)- and (Z)-isomers.
(E)-Hinokiresinol is the source of the heartwood colour for Chamaecyparis obtusa (hinoki cypress),4 and is typically found in conifer heartwood together with other norlignans,5–8 in contrast to the distribution of (Z)-hinokiresinol in monocotyledonous herbs including A. officinalis.2,3
We have demonstrated for the first time the biosynthetic process and enzymatic formation of (Z)-hinokiresinol using the A. officinalis cell system (Scheme 1), the formation of 4-coumaryl 4-coumarate by the coupling of 4-coumaryl alcohol and 4-coumaroyl CoA, and the subsequent rearrangement to yield (Z)-hinokiresinol.2,3
Our attention was next directed to the biosynthesis of (E)-hinokiresinol in relation to heartwood formation.
Herein, we report for the first time, enzymatic (E)-hinokiresinol formation using the Cryptomeria japonica (Japanese cedar) cell system as an enzyme source.
Callus was initiated from the shoot tips excised aseptically from stems of C. japonica cv.
Kumotooshi (collected at Wakayama University Forest, Kyoto University, in November 2002) on Murashige and Skoog (MS) gel medium (0.3% phytagel, 2% sucrose, 1 × 10−3 g l−1 of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and 1 × 10−4 g l−1 of kinetin).
A cell-suspension culture was obtained by transferring callus crumps to the MS liquid medium: 1% sucrose, 0.7 g l−1 of KCl, 0.93 g l−1 of KNO3, free of NH4NO3, 1 × 10−3 g l−1 of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and 1 × 10−4 g l−1 of kinetin.
The culture was maintained by continuous shaking (80 rpm) at 25 °C in the dark.
The cells were maintained for over one year by repeated subculturing every 10 days.
Cell-free extracts were prepared as described previously.3
Briefly, the cells incubated for 10 days after the last subculturing were frozen with liquid nitrogen and pulverized with a mortar and pestle.
The powder obtained was ground in the presence of polyclar AT (30% of cell weight), sea sand, and 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (THB) (pH 7.8) containing 15 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (ME), and the resultant slurry was filtered with gauze.
The filtrate obtained was centrifuged, and the supernatant was applied to a Sephadex G-25 column, which had been pre-equilibrated and was eluted with 20 mM THB (pH 7.8) containing 15 mM ME.
To the excluded fraction was added ammonium sulfate (0–70% saturation), and the resulting precipitates were recovered by centrifugation and desalted by passing through a Sephadex G-25 column as above.
The effluent was used as the enzyme preparation.
Two distinct phenylpropanoid monomers, 4-[7,9,9-2H3]coumaryl alcohol and 4-coumaroyl CoA3 were incubated with the enzyme preparation at 30 °C (Table 1, A-1) and then the product was analysed by GC-MS as previously described.3
The mass spectrum (Fig. 1A) is that of authentic (Z)-hinokiresinol TMS ether showing principal ions at m/z 396 (molecular ion, [M]+) and 230.
Although the mass spectrum is quite similar to that of (E)-hinokiresinol TMS ether (Fig. 1B), the (Z)- and (E)-isomers are distinguishable from each other by retention times (tR), as shown in Fig. 2A.
Fig. 1C is the spectrum of the (E)-hinokiresinol fraction obtained following incubation of 4-[7,9,9-2H3]coumaryl alcohol and 4-coumaroyl CoA with the enzyme preparation, and its tR is shown in Fig. 2B.
As can be seen in Fig 1C, in addition to the ions at m/z 396 and 230 which are derived from the unlabelled internal standard, ions at m/z 399 ([M]+ + 3) and 233 are found, indicating the formation of (E)-[2H3]hinokiresinol.
The slightly smaller tR in the selected ion monitoring (SIM) chromatogram of m/z 399 of the fraction (16.54 min, Fig. 2B) compared to that of molecular ion (m/z 396) of unlabelled (E)-hinokiresinol (16.57 min, Fig. 2A), which is ascribed to the well-known isotope effect on GC retention time, further supports the formation of the deuterium labelled (E)-hinokiresinol.
Proof that the formation of (E)-[2H3]hinokiresinol was enzymatic was obtained by control experiments (Table 1); the formation of (E)-[2H3]hinokiresinol from 4-[7,9,9-2H3]coumaryl alcohol and 4-coumaroyl CoA was not observed when the denatured enzyme preparation was used, and when the enzyme preparation or the substrate(s) were omitted from the complete assay.
Next we incubated (7E,7′E)-4-[7′,9′,9′-2H3]coumaryl 4-coumarate3 with the enzyme preparation at 30 °C.
Like the result observed with the conversion of 4-[7,9,9-2H3]coumaryl alcohol and 4-coumaroyl CoA, (7E,7′E)-4-[7′,9′,9′-2H3]coumaryl 4-coumarate was found to be efficiently converted to (E)-[2H3]hinokiresinol (Figs. 1D and 2C, and Table 1, B-1).
To eliminate the involvement of (Z)-hinokiresinol as an intermediate in the formation of (E)-hinokiresinol, we incubated (E)-hinokiresinol and (Z)-hinokiresinol individually with the enzyme preparation.
GC-MS analysis showed that neither (Z)- nor (E)-hinokiresinol was converted to the corresponding geometrical isomers under the conditions employed (data not shown), indicating that (E)-hinokiresinol was directly formed from 4-coumaryl 4-coumarate with the enzyme preparation, but not via (Z)-hinokiresinol.
Taken together, our results have provided evidence for the (E)-hinokiresinol synthesizing system, which does not involve (Z)-hinokiresinol as an intermediate.
In addition, the present results, together with our previous report,3 indicate that there are at least two hinokiresinol synthesizing systems in plants; one giving rise to the (E)-isomer, the other to the (Z)-isomer.
They are probably two distinct hinokiresinol synthases, namely (E)- and (Z)-hinokiresinol synthases catalysing the direct conversion of (7E,7′E)-4-coumaryl 4-coumarate to (E)-hinokiresinol and (Z)-hinokiresinol, respectively.
In fact, we have demonstrated that a purified Asparagus enzyme transformed (7E,7′E)-4-coumaryl 4-coumarate to (Z)-hinokiresinol (unpublished).
However, it is still possible that (7E,7′E)-4-coumaryl 4-coumarate was first isomerised to (7Z,7′E)-4-coumaryl 4-coumarate which was then transformed to give rise to (E)-hinokiresinol by the Cryptomeria crude enzyme preparation.
In conclusion, the present study has demonstrated for the first time enzyme preparation catalysed (E)-hinokiresinol formation and this is the first report of the enzymatic formation of a heartwood norlignan.
